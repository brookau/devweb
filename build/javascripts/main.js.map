To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using\n * {@link angular.bootstrap} instead.

This\n * module will be loaded into the {@link auto.$injector} when the application is bootstrapped. It\n * should contain the application code needed or have dependencies on other modules that will\n * contain the code. See {@link angular.module} for more information.\n *\n * In the example below if the `ngApp` directive were not placed on the `html` element then the\n * document would not be compiled, the `AppController` would not be instantiated and the `{{ a+b }}`\n * would not be resolved to `3`.\n *\n * `ngApp` is the easiest, and most common way to bootstrap an application.\n *\n <example module=\"ngAppDemo\">\n   <file name=\"index.html\">\n   <div ng-controller=\"ngAppDemoController\">\n     I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}\n   </div>\n   </file>\n   <file name=\"script.js\">\n   angular.module('ngAppDemo', []).controller('ngAppDemoController', function($scope) {\n     $scope.a = 1;\n     $scope.b = 2;\n   });\n   </file>\n </example>\n *\n * Using `ngStrictDi`, you would see something like this:\n *\n <example ng-app-included=\"true\">\n   <file name=\"index.html\">\n   <div ng-app=\"ngAppStrictDemo\" ng-strict-di>\n       <div ng-controller=\"GoodController1\">\n           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}\n\n           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to\n              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style (see\n              script.js for details)\n           </p>\n       </div>\n\n       <div ng-controller=\"GoodController2\">\n           Name: <input ng-model=\"name\"><br />\n           Hello, {{name}}!\n\n           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to\n              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style\n              (see script.js for details)\n           </p>\n       </div>\n\n       <div ng-controller=\"BadController\">\n           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}\n\n           <p>The controller could not be instantiated, due to relying\n              on automatic function annotations (which are disabled in\n              strict mode).

@description\n * Wraps a raw DOM element or HTML string as a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) element.\n *\n * If jQuery is available, `angular.element` is an alias for the\n * [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/) function. If jQuery is not available, `angular.element`\n * delegates to Angular's built-in subset of jQuery, called \"jQuery lite\" or \"jqLite.\"\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-success\">jqLite is a tiny, API-compatible subset of jQuery that allows\n * Angular to manipulate the DOM in a cross-browser compatible way. **jqLite** implements only the most\n * commonly needed functionality with the goal of having a very small footprint.</div>\n *\n * To use jQuery, simply load it before `DOMContentLoaded` event fired.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert\">**Note:** all element references in Angular are always wrapped with jQuery or\n * jqLite; they are never raw DOM references.</div>\n *\n * ## Angular's jqLite\n * jqLite provides only the following jQuery methods:\n *\n * - [`addClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/addClass/)\n * - [`after()`](http://api.jquery.com/after/)\n * - [`append()`](http://api.jquery.com/append/)\n * - [`attr()`](http://api.jquery.com/attr/) - Does not support functions as parameters\n * - [`bind()`](http://api.jquery.com/bind/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData\n * - [`children()`](http://api.jquery.com/children/) - Does not support selectors\n * - [`clone()`](http://api.jquery.com/clone/)\n * - [`contents()`](http://api.jquery.com/contents/)\n * - [`css()`](http://api.jquery.com/css/) - Only retrieves inline-styles, does not call `getComputedStyle()`\n * - [`data()`](http://api.jquery.com/data/)\n * - [`detach()`](http://api.jquery.com/detach/)\n * - [`empty()`](http://api.jquery.com/empty/)\n * - [`eq()`](http://api.jquery.com/eq/)\n * - [`find()`](http://api.jquery.com/find/) - Limited to lookups by tag name\n * - [`hasClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/)\n * - [`html()`](http://api.jquery.com/html/)\n * - [`next()`](http://api.jquery.com/next/) - Does not support selectors\n * - [`on()`](http://api.jquery.com/on/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData\n * - [`off()`](http://api.jquery.com/off/) - Does not support namespaces or selectors\n * - [`one()`](http://api.jquery.com/one/) - Does not support namespaces or selectors\n * - [`parent()`](http://api.jquery.com/parent/) - Does not support selectors\n * - [`prepend()`](http://api.jquery.com/prepend/)\n * - [`prop()`](http://api.jquery.com/prop/)\n * - [`ready()`](http://api.jquery.com/ready/)\n * - [`remove()`](http://api.jquery.com/remove/)\n * - [`removeAttr()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/)\n * - [`removeClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/)\n * - [`removeData()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeData/)\n * - [`replaceWith()`](http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/)\n * - [`text()`](http://api.jquery.com/text/)\n * - [`toggleClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/)\n * - [`triggerHandler()`](http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/) - Passes a dummy event object to handlers.\n * - [`unbind()`](http://api.jquery.com/unbind/) - Does not support namespaces\n * - [`val()`](http://api.jquery.com/val/)\n * - [`wrap()`](http://api.jquery.com/wrap/)\n *\n * ## jQuery/jqLite Extras\n * Angular also provides the following additional methods and events to both jQuery and jqLite:\n *\n * ### Events\n * - `$destroy` - AngularJS intercepts all jqLite/jQuery's DOM destruction apis and fires this event\n *    on all DOM nodes being removed.  This can be used to clean up any 3rd party bindings to the DOM\n *    element before it is removed.\n *\n * ### Methods\n * - `controller(name)` - retrieves the controller of the current element or its parent. By default\n *   retrieves controller associated with the `ngController` directive. If `name` is provided as\n *   camelCase directive name, then the controller for this directive will be retrieved (e.g.\n *   `'ngModel'`).\n * - `injector()` - retrieves the injector of the current element or its parent.\n * - `scope()` - retrieves the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} of the current\n *   element or its parent. Requires {@link guide/production#disabling-debug-data Debug Data} to\n *   be enabled.\n * - `isolateScope()` - retrieves an isolate {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} if one is attached directly to the\n *   current element. This getter should be used only on elements that contain a directive which starts a new isolate\n *   scope. Calling `scope()` on this element always returns the original non-isolate scope.\n *   Requires {@link guide/production#disabling-debug-data Debug Data} to be enabled.\n * - `inheritedData()` - same as `data()`, but walks up the DOM until a value is found or the top\n *   parent element is reached.\n *\n * @param {string|DOMElement} element HTML string or DOMElement to be wrapped into jQuery.\n * @returns {Object} jQuery object.\n */\n\nJQLite.expando = 'ng339';\n\nvar jqCache = JQLite.cache = {},\n    jqId = 1,\n    addEventListenerFn = function(element, type, fn) {\n      element.addEventListener(type, fn, false);\n    },\n    removeEventListenerFn = function(element, type, fn) {\n      element.removeEventListener(type, fn, false);\n    };\n\n/*\n * !!!

Importantly, you can configure what kind of service is created by the `$get`\n * method, or how that service will act. For example, the {@link ng.$logProvider $logProvider} has a\n * method {@link ng.$logProvider#debugEnabled debugEnabled}\n * which lets you specify whether the {@link ng.$log $log} service will log debug messages to the\n * console or not.\n *\n * @param {string} name The name of the instance.

You can see the default values below.\n * </div>\n *\n * Therefore the above can be simplified as:\n *\n * ```js\n *   var myModule = angular.module(...);\n *\n *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {\n *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {\n *       link: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }\n *     };\n *     return directiveDefinitionObject;\n *     // or\n *     // return function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }\n *   });\n * ```\n *\n *\n *\n * ### Directive Definition Object\n *\n * The directive definition object provides instructions to the {@link ng.$compile\n * compiler}. The attributes are:\n *\n * #### `multiElement`\n * When this property is set to true, the HTML compiler will collect DOM nodes between\n * nodes with the attributes `directive-name-start` and `directive-name-end`, and group them\n * together as the directive elements. It is recommended that this feature be used on directives\n * which are not strictly behavioural (such as {@link ngClick}), and which\n * do not manipulate or replace child nodes (such as {@link ngInclude}).\n *\n * #### `priority`\n * When there are multiple directives defined on a single DOM element, sometimes it\n * is necessary to specify the order in which the directives are applied. The `priority` is used\n * to sort the directives before their `compile` functions get called. Priority is defined as a\n * number. Directives with greater numerical `priority` are compiled first. Pre-link functions\n * are also run in priority order, but post-link functions are run in reverse order. The order\n * of directives with the same priority is undefined. The default priority is `0`.\n *\n * #### `terminal`\n * If set to true then the current `priority` will be the last set of directives\n * which will execute (any directives at the current priority will still execute\n * as the order of execution on same `priority` is undefined). Note that expressions\n * and other directives used in the directive's template will also be excluded from execution.\n *\n * #### `scope`\n * **If set to `true`,** then a new scope will be created for this directive. If multiple directives on the\n * same element request a new scope, only one new scope is created. The new scope rule does not\n * apply for the root of the template since the root of the template always gets a new scope.\n *\n * **If set to `{}` (object hash),** then a new \"isolate\" scope is created. The 'isolate' scope differs from\n * normal scope in that it does not prototypically inherit from the parent scope. This is useful\n * when creating reusable components, which should not accidentally read or modify data in the\n * parent scope.\n *\n * The 'isolate' scope takes an object hash which defines a set of local scope properties\n * derived from the parent scope. These local properties are useful for aliasing values for\n * templates. Locals definition is a hash of local scope property to its source:\n *\n * * `@` or `@attr` - bind a local scope property to the value of DOM attribute. The result is\n *   always a string since DOM attributes are strings. If no `attr` name is specified  then the\n *   attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.\n *   Given `<widget my-attr=\"hello {{name}}\">` and widget definition\n *   of `scope: { localName:'@myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localName` will reflect\n *   the interpolated value of `hello {{name}}`. As the `name` attribute changes so will the\n *   `localName` property on the widget scope. The `name` is read from the parent scope (not\n *   component scope).\n *\n * * `=` or `=attr` - set up bi-directional binding between a local scope property and the\n *   parent scope property of name defined via the value of the `attr` attribute. If no `attr`\n *   name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.\n *   Given `<widget my-attr=\"parentModel\">` and widget definition of\n *   `scope: { localModel:'=myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localModel` will reflect the\n *   value of `parentModel` on the parent scope. Any changes to `parentModel` will be reflected\n *   in `localModel` and any changes in `localModel` will reflect in `parentModel`. If the parent\n *   scope property doesn't exist, it will throw a NON_ASSIGNABLE_MODEL_EXPRESSION exception. You\n *   can avoid this behavior using `=?` or `=?attr` in order to flag the property as optional. If\n *   you want to shallow watch for changes (i.e. $watchCollection instead of $watch) you can use\n *   `=*` or `=*attr` (`=*?` or `=*?attr` if the property is optional).\n *\n * * `&` or `&attr` - provides a way to execute an expression in the context of the parent scope.\n *   If no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the\n *   local name. Given `<widget my-attr=\"count = count + value\">` and widget definition of\n *   `scope: { localFn:'&myAttr' }`, then isolate scope property `localFn` will point to\n *   a function wrapper for the `count = count + value` expression. Often it's desirable to\n *   pass data from the isolated scope via an expression to the parent scope, this can be\n *   done by passing a map of local variable names and values into the expression wrapper fn.\n *   For example, if the expression is `increment(amount)` then we can specify the amount value\n *   by calling the `localFn` as `localFn({amount: 22})`.\n *\n *\n * #### `bindToController`\n * When an isolate scope is used for a component (see above), and `controllerAs` is used, `bindToController: true` will\n * allow a component to have its properties bound to the controller, rather than to scope. When the controller\n * is instantiated, the initial values of the isolate scope bindings are already available.\n *\n * #### `controller`\n * Controller constructor function. The controller is instantiated before the\n * pre-linking phase and it is shared with other directives (see\n * `require` attribute). This allows the directives to communicate with each other and augment\n * each other's behavior. The controller is injectable (and supports bracket notation) with the following locals:\n *\n * * `$scope` - Current scope associated with the element\n * * `$element` - Current element\n * * `$attrs` - Current attributes object for the element\n * * `$transclude` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope:\n *   `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement)`.\n *    * `scope`: optional argument to override the scope.\n *    * `cloneLinkingFn`: optional argument to create clones of the original transcluded content.\n *    * `futureParentElement`:\n *        * defines the parent to which the `cloneLinkingFn` will add the cloned elements.\n *        * default: `$element.parent()` resp. `$element` for `transclude:'element'` resp. `transclude:true`.\n *        * only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html elements (e.g. SVG elements)\n *          and when the `cloneLinkinFn` is passed,\n *          as those elements need to created and cloned in a special way when they are defined outside their\n *          usual containers (e.g. like `<svg>`).\n *        * See also the `directive.templateNamespace` property.\n *\n *\n * #### `require`\n * Require another directive and inject its controller as the fourth argument to the linking function. The\n * `require` takes a string name (or array of strings) of the directive(s) to pass in. If an array is used, the\n * injected argument will be an array in corresponding order. If no such directive can be\n * found, or if the directive does not have a controller, then an error is raised. The name can be prefixed with:\n *\n * * (no prefix) - Locate the required controller on the current element. Throw an error if not found.\n * * `?` - Attempt to locate the required controller or pass `null` to the `link` fn if not found.\n * * `^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents. Throw an error if not found.\n * * `^^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element's parents. Throw an error if not found.\n * * `?^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents or pass\n *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.\n * * `?^^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element's parents, or pass\n *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.\n *\n *\n * #### `controllerAs`\n * Controller alias at the directive scope. An alias for the controller so it\n * can be referenced at the directive template. The directive needs to define a scope for this\n * configuration to be used. Useful in the case when directive is used as component.\n *\n *\n * #### `restrict`\n * String of subset of `EACM` which restricts the directive to a specific directive\n * declaration style. If omitted, the defaults (elements and attributes) are used.\n *\n * * `E` - Element name (default): `<my-directive></my-directive>`\n * * `A` - Attribute (default): `<div my-directive=\"exp\"></div>`\n * * `C` - Class: `<div class=\"my-directive: exp;\"></div>`\n * * `M` - Comment: `<!-- directive: my-directive exp -->`\n *\n *\n * #### `templateNamespace`\n * String representing the document type used by the markup in the template.\n * AngularJS needs this information as those elements need to be created and cloned\n * in a special way when they are defined outside their usual containers like `<svg>` and `<math>`.\n *\n * * `html` - All root nodes in the template are HTML. Root nodes may also be\n *   top-level elements such as `<svg>` or `<math>`.\n * * `svg` - The root nodes in the template are SVG elements (excluding `<math>`).\n * * `math` - The root nodes in the template are MathML elements (excluding `<svg>`).\n *\n * If no `templateNamespace` is specified, then the namespace is considered to be `html`.\n *\n * #### `template`\n * HTML markup that may:\n * * Replace the contents of the directive's element (default).\n * * Replace the directive's element itself (if `replace` is true - DEPRECATED).\n * * Wrap the contents of the directive's element (if `transclude` is true).\n *\n * Value may be:\n *\n * * A string. For example `<div red-on-hover>{{delete_str}}</div>`.\n * * A function which takes two arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile`\n *   function api below) and returns a string value.\n *\n *\n * #### `templateUrl`\n * This is similar to `template` but the template is loaded from the specified URL, asynchronously.\n *\n * Because template loading is asynchronous the compiler will suspend compilation of directives on that element\n * for later when the template has been resolved.  In the meantime it will continue to compile and link\n * sibling and parent elements as though this element had not contained any directives.\n *\n * The compiler does not suspend the entire compilation to wait for templates to be loaded because this\n * would result in the whole app \"stalling\" until all templates are loaded asynchronously - even in the\n * case when only one deeply nested directive has `templateUrl`.\n *\n * Template loading is asynchronous even if the template has been preloaded into the {@link $templateCache}\n *\n * You can specify `templateUrl` as a string representing the URL or as a function which takes two\n * arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile` function api below) and returns\n * a string value representing the url.  In either case, the template URL is passed through {@link\n * $sce#getTrustedResourceUrl $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl}.\n *\n *\n * #### `replace` ([*DEPRECATED*!], will be removed in next major release - i.e. v2.0)\n * specify what the template should replace. Defaults to `false`.\n *\n * * `true` - the template will replace the directive's element.\n * * `false` - the template will replace the contents of the directive's element.\n *\n * The replacement process migrates all of the attributes / classes from the old element to the new\n * one. See the {@link guide/directive#template-expanding-directive\n * Directives Guide} for an example.\n *\n * There are very few scenarios where element replacement is required for the application function,\n * the main one being reusable custom components that are used within SVG contexts\n * (because SVG doesn't work with custom elements in the DOM tree).\n *\n * #### `transclude`\n * Extract the contents of the element where the directive appears and make it available to the directive.\n * The contents are compiled and provided to the directive as a **transclusion function**. See the\n * {@link $compile#transclusion Transclusion} section below.\n *\n * There are two kinds of transclusion depending upon whether you want to transclude just the contents of the\n * directive's element or the entire element:\n *\n * * `true` - transclude the content (i.e. the child nodes) of the directive's element.\n * * `'element'` - transclude the whole of the directive's element including any directives on this\n *   element that defined at a lower priority than this directive. When used, the `template`\n *   property is ignored.\n *\n *\n * #### `compile`\n *\n * ```js\n *   function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * The compile function deals with transforming the template DOM. Since most directives do not do\n * template transformation, it is not used often. The compile function takes the following arguments:\n *\n *   * `tElement` - template element - The element where the directive has been declared. It is\n *     safe to do template transformation on the element and child elements only.\n *\n *   * `tAttrs` - template attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared\n *     between all directive compile functions.\n *\n *   * `transclude` -  [*DEPRECATED*!] A transclude linking function: `function(scope, cloneLinkingFn)`\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** The template instance and the link instance may be different objects if the template has\n * been cloned. For this reason it is **not** safe to do anything other than DOM transformations that\n * apply to all cloned DOM nodes within the compile function. Specifically, DOM listener registration\n * should be done in a linking function rather than in a compile function.\n * </div>\n\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** The compile function cannot handle directives that recursively use themselves in their\n * own templates or compile functions. Compiling these directives results in an infinite loop and a\n * stack overflow errors.\n *\n * This can be avoided by manually using $compile in the postLink function to imperatively compile\n * a directive's template instead of relying on automatic template compilation via `template` or\n * `templateUrl` declaration or manual compilation inside the compile function.\n * </div>\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-error\">\n * **Note:** The `transclude` function that is passed to the compile function is deprecated, as it\n *   e.g. does not know about the right outer scope. Please use the transclude function that is passed\n *   to the link function instead.\n * </div>\n\n * A compile function can have a return value which can be either a function or an object.\n *\n * * returning a (post-link) function - is equivalent to registering the linking function via the\n *   `link` property of the config object when the compile function is empty.\n *\n * * returning an object with function(s) registered via `pre` and `post` properties - allows you to\n *   control when a linking function should be called during the linking phase. See info about\n *   pre-linking and post-linking functions below.\n *\n *\n * #### `link`\n * This property is used only if the `compile` property is not defined.\n *\n * ```js\n *   function link(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller, transcludeFn) { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * The link function is responsible for registering DOM listeners as well as updating the DOM. It is\n * executed after the template has been cloned. This is where most of the directive logic will be\n * put.\n *\n *   * `scope` - {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} - The scope to be used by the\n *     directive for registering {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watches}.\n *\n *   * `iElement` - instance element - The element where the directive is to be used. It is safe to\n *     manipulate the children of the element only in `postLink` function since the children have\n *     already been linked.\n *\n *   * `iAttrs` - instance attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared\n *     between all directive linking functions.\n *\n *   * `controller` - a controller instance - A controller instance if at least one directive on the\n *     element defines a controller. The controller is shared among all the directives, which allows\n *     the directives to use the controllers as a communication channel.\n *\n *   * `transcludeFn` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.\n *     This is the same as the `$transclude`\n *     parameter of directive controllers, see there for details.\n *     `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement)`.\n *\n * #### Pre-linking function\n *\n * Executed before the child elements are linked. Not safe to do DOM transformation since the\n * compiler linking function will fail to locate the correct elements for linking.\n *\n * #### Post-linking function\n *\n * Executed after the child elements are linked.\n *\n * Note that child elements that contain `templateUrl` directives will not have been compiled\n * and linked since they are waiting for their template to load asynchronously and their own\n * compilation and linking has been suspended until that occurs.\n *\n * It is safe to do DOM transformation in the post-linking function on elements that are not waiting\n * for their async templates to be resolved.\n *\n *\n * ### Transclusion\n *\n * Transclusion is the process of extracting a collection of DOM element from one part of the DOM and\n * copying them to another part of the DOM, while maintaining their connection to the original AngularJS\n * scope from where they were taken.\n *\n * Transclusion is used (often with {@link ngTransclude}) to insert the\n * original contents of a directive's element into a specified place in the template of the directive.\n * The benefit of transclusion, over simply moving the DOM elements manually, is that the transcluded\n * content has access to the properties on the scope from which it was taken, even if the directive\n * has isolated scope.\n * See the {@link guide/directive#creating-a-directive-that-wraps-other-elements Directives Guide}.\n *\n * This makes it possible for the widget to have private state for its template, while the transcluded\n * content has access to its originating scope.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** When testing an element transclude directive you must not place the directive at the root of the\n * DOM fragment that is being compiled. See {@link guide/unit-testing#testing-transclusion-directives\n * Testing Transclusion Directives}.\n * </div>\n *\n * #### Transclusion Functions\n *\n * When a directive requests transclusion, the compiler extracts its contents and provides a **transclusion\n * function** to the directive's `link` function and `controller`. This transclusion function is a special\n * **linking function** that will return the compiled contents linked to a new transclusion scope.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n * If you are just using {@link ngTransclude} then you don't need to worry about this function, since\n * ngTransclude will deal with it for us.\n * </div>\n *\n * If you want to manually control the insertion and removal of the transcluded content in your directive\n * then you must use this transclude function. When you call a transclude function it returns a a jqLite/JQuery\n * object that contains the compiled DOM, which is linked to the correct transclusion scope.\n *\n * When you call a transclusion function you can pass in a **clone attach function**. This function accepts\n * two parameters, `function(clone, scope) { ... }`, where the `clone` is a fresh compiled copy of your transcluded\n * content and the `scope` is the newly created transclusion scope, to which the clone is bound.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n * **Best Practice**: Always provide a `cloneFn` (clone attach function) when you call a translude function\n * since you then get a fresh clone of the original DOM and also have access to the new transclusion scope.\n * </div>\n *\n * It is normal practice to attach your transcluded content (`clone`) to the DOM inside your **clone\n * attach function**:\n *\n * ```js\n * var transcludedContent, transclusionScope;\n *\n * $transclude(function(clone, scope) {\n *   element.append(clone);\n *   transcludedContent = clone;\n *   transclusionScope = scope;\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Later, if you want to remove the transcluded content from your DOM then you should also destroy the\n * associated transclusion scope:\n *\n * ```js\n * transcludedContent.remove();\n * transclusionScope.$destroy();\n * ```\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n * **Best Practice**: if you intend to add and remove transcluded content manually in your directive\n * (by calling the transclude function to get the DOM and and calling `element.remove()` to remove it),\n * then you are also responsible for calling `$destroy` on the transclusion scope.\n * </div>\n *\n * The built-in DOM manipulation directives, such as {@link ngIf}, {@link ngSwitch} and {@link ngRepeat}\n * automatically destroy their transluded clones as necessary so you do not need to worry about this if\n * you are simply using {@link ngTransclude} to inject the transclusion into your directive.\n *\n *\n * #### Transclusion Scopes\n *\n * When you call a transclude function it returns a DOM fragment that is pre-bound to a **transclusion\n * scope**. This scope is special, in that it is a child of the directive's scope (and so gets destroyed\n * when the directive's scope gets destroyed) but it inherits the properties of the scope from which it\n * was taken.\n *\n * For example consider a directive that uses transclusion and isolated scope. The DOM hierarchy might look\n * like this:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-app>\n *   <div isolate>\n *     <div transclusion>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * The `$parent` scope hierarchy will look like this:\n *\n * ```\n * - $rootScope\n *   - isolate\n *     - transclusion\n * ```\n *\n * but the scopes will inherit prototypically from different scopes to their `$parent`.\n *\n * ```\n * - $rootScope\n *   - transclusion\n * - isolate\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Attributes\n *\n * The {@link ng.$compile.directive.Attributes Attributes} object - passed as a parameter in the\n * `link()` or `compile()` functions. It has a variety of uses.\n *\n * accessing *Normalized attribute names:*\n * Directives like 'ngBind' can be expressed in many ways: 'ng:bind', `data-ng-bind`, or 'x-ng-bind'.\n * the attributes object allows for normalized access to\n *   the attributes.\n *\n * * *Directive inter-communication:* All directives share the same instance of the attributes\n *   object which allows the directives to use the attributes object as inter directive\n *   communication.\n *\n * * *Supports interpolation:* Interpolation attributes are assigned to the attribute object\n *   allowing other directives to read the interpolated value.\n *\n * * *Observing interpolated attributes:* Use `$observe` to observe the value changes of attributes\n *   that contain interpolation (e.g. `src=\"{{bar}}\"`). Not only is this very efficient but it's also\n *   the only way to easily get the actual value because during the linking phase the interpolation\n *   hasn't been evaluated yet and so the value is at this time set to `undefined`.\n *\n * ```js\n * function linkingFn(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) {\n *   // get the attribute value\n *   console.log(attrs.ngModel);\n *\n *   // change the attribute\n *   attrs.$set('ngModel', 'new value');\n *\n *   // observe changes to interpolated attribute\n *   attrs.$observe('ngModel', function(value) {\n *     console.log('ngModel has changed value to ' + value);\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ## Example\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note**: Typically directives are registered with `module.directive`.

Where:\n *\n *  * `scope` - A {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} to bind to.\n *  * `cloneAttachFn` - If `cloneAttachFn` is provided, then the link function will clone the\n *  `template` and call the `cloneAttachFn` function allowing the caller to attach the\n *  cloned elements to the DOM document at the appropriate place. The `cloneAttachFn` is\n *  called as: <br> `cloneAttachFn(clonedElement, scope)` where:\n *\n *      * `clonedElement` - is a clone of the original `element` passed into the compiler.\n *      * `scope` - is the current scope with which the linking function is working with.\n *\n *  * `options` - An optional object hash with linking options. If `options` is provided, then the following\n *  keys may be used to control linking behavior:\n *\n *      * `parentBoundTranscludeFn` - the transclude function made available to\n *        directives; if given, it will be passed through to the link functions of\n *        directives found in `element` during compilation.\n *      * `transcludeControllers` - an object hash with keys that map controller names\n *        to controller instances; if given, it will make the controllers\n *        available to directives.\n *      * `futureParentElement` - defines the parent to which the `cloneAttachFn` will add\n *        the cloned elements; only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html\n *        elements (e.g. SVG elements). See also the directive.controller property.\n *\n * Calling the linking function returns the element of the template. It is either the original\n * element passed in, or the clone of the element if the `cloneAttachFn` is provided.\n *\n * After linking the view is not updated until after a call to $digest which typically is done by\n * Angular automatically.\n *\n * If you need access to the bound view, there are two ways to do it:\n *\n * - If you are not asking the linking function to clone the template, create the DOM element(s)\n *   before you send them to the compiler and keep this reference around.\n *   ```js\n *     var element = $compile('<p>{{total}}</p>')(scope);\n *   ```\n *\n * - if on the other hand, you need the element to be cloned, the view reference from the original\n *   example would not point to the clone, but rather to the original template that was cloned. In\n *   this case, you can access the clone via the cloneAttachFn:\n *   ```js\n *     var templateElement = angular.element('<p>{{total}}</p>'),\n *         scope = ....;\n *\n *     var clonedElement = $compile(templateElement)(scope, function(clonedElement, scope) {\n *       //attach the clone to DOM document at the right place\n *     });\n *\n *     //now we have reference to the cloned DOM via `clonedElement`\n *   ```\n *\n *\n * For information on how the compiler works, see the\n * {@link guide/compiler Angular HTML Compiler} section of the Developer Guide.\n */\n\nvar $compileMinErr = minErr('$compile');\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc provider\n * @name $compileProvider\n *\n * @description\n */\n$CompileProvider.$inject = ['$provide', '$$sanitizeUriProvider'];\nfunction $CompileProvider($provide, $$sanitizeUriProvider) {\n  var hasDirectives = {},\n      Suffix = 'Directive',\n      COMMENT_DIRECTIVE_REGEXP = /^\\s*directive\\:\\s*([\\w\\-]+)\\s+(.*)$/,\n      CLASS_DIRECTIVE_REGEXP = /(([\\w\\-]+)(?:\\:([^;]+))?;?)/,\n      ALL_OR_NOTHING_ATTRS = makeMap('ngSrc,ngSrcset,src,srcset'),\n      REQUIRE_PREFIX_REGEXP = /^(?:(\\^\\^?)?(\\?)?(\\^\\^?)?)?/;\n\n  // Ref: http://developers.whatwg.org/webappapis.html#event-handler-idl-attributes\n  // The assumption is that future DOM event attribute names will begin with\n  // 'on' and be composed of only English letters.\n  var EVENT_HANDLER_ATTR_REGEXP = /^(on[a-z]+|formaction)$/;\n\n  function parseIsolateBindings(scope, directiveName) {\n    var LOCAL_REGEXP = /^\\s*([@&]|=(\\*?))(\\??)\\s*(\\w*)\\s*$/;\n\n    var bindings = {};\n\n    forEach(scope, function(definition, scopeName) {\n      var match = definition.match(LOCAL_REGEXP);\n\n      if (!match) {\n        throw $compileMinErr('iscp',\n            \"Invalid isolate scope definition for directive '{0}'.\" +\n            \" Definition: {... {1}: '{2}' ...}\",\n            directiveName, scopeName, definition);\n      }\n\n      bindings[scopeName] = {\n        mode: match[1][0],\n        collection: match[2] === '*',\n        optional: match[3] === '?',\n        attrName: match[4] || scopeName\n      };\n    });\n\n    return bindings;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @ngdoc method\n   * @name $compileProvider#directive\n   * @kind function\n   *\n   * @description\n   * Register a new directive with the compiler.\n   *\n   * @param {string|Object} name Name of the directive in camel-case (i.e. <code>ngBind</code> which\n   *    will match as <code>ng-bind</code>), or an object map of directives where the keys are the\n   *    names and the values are the factories.\n   * @param {Function|Array} directiveFactory An injectable directive factory function.

While for simple usage patterns this doesn't matter much, for advanced usage\n     * it is important to familiarize yourself with these APIs and the guarantees they provide.\n     *\n     *\n     * ## General usage\n     * The `$http` service is a function which takes a single argument — a configuration object —\n     * that is used to generate an HTTP request and returns  a {@link ng.$q promise}\n     * with two $http specific methods: `success` and `error`.\n     *\n     * ```js\n     *   // Simple GET request example :\n     *   $http.get('/someUrl').\n     *     success(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n     *       // this callback will be called asynchronously\n     *       // when the response is available\n     *     }).\n     *     error(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n     *       // called asynchronously if an error occurs\n     *       // or server returns response with an error status.\n     *     });\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ```js\n     *   // Simple POST request example (passing data) :\n     *   $http.post('/someUrl', {msg:'hello word!'}).\n     *     success(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n     *       // this callback will be called asynchronously\n     *       // when the response is available\n     *     }).\n     *     error(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n     *       // called asynchronously if an error occurs\n     *       // or server returns response with an error status.\n     *     });\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     * Since the returned value of calling the $http function is a `promise`, you can also use\n     * the `then` method to register callbacks, and these callbacks will receive a single argument –\n     * an object representing the response. See the API signature and type info below for more\n     * details.\n     *\n     * A response status code between 200 and 299 is considered a success status and\n     * will result in the success callback being called. Note that if the response is a redirect,\n     * XMLHttpRequest will transparently follow it, meaning that the error callback will not be\n     * called for such responses.\n     *\n     * ## Writing Unit Tests that use $http\n     * When unit testing (using {@link ngMock ngMock}), it is necessary to call\n     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend#flush $httpBackend.flush()} to flush each pending\n     * request using trained responses.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * $httpBackend.expectGET(...);\n     * $http.get(...);\n     * $httpBackend.flush();\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ## Shortcut methods\n     *\n     * Shortcut methods are also available. All shortcut methods require passing in the URL, and\n     * request data must be passed in for POST/PUT requests.\n     *\n     * ```js\n     *   $http.get('/someUrl').success(successCallback);\n     *   $http.post('/someUrl', data).success(successCallback);\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Complete list of shortcut methods:\n     *\n     * - {@link ng.$http#get $http.get}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#head $http.head}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#post $http.post}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#put $http.put}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#delete $http.delete}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#jsonp $http.jsonp}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#patch $http.patch}\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Setting HTTP Headers\n     *\n     * The $http service will automatically add certain HTTP headers to all requests. These defaults\n     * can be fully configured by accessing the `$httpProvider.defaults.headers` configuration\n     * object, which currently contains this default configuration:\n     *\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common` (headers that are common for all requests):\n     *   - `Accept: application/json, text/plain, * / *`\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.post`: (header defaults for POST requests)\n     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.put` (header defaults for PUT requests)\n     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`\n     *\n     * To add or overwrite these defaults, simply add or remove a property from these configuration\n     * objects. To add headers for an HTTP method other than POST or PUT, simply add a new object\n     * with the lowercased HTTP method name as the key, e.g.\n     * `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.get = { 'My-Header' : 'value' }.\n     *\n     * The defaults can also be set at runtime via the `$http.defaults` object in the same\n     * fashion. For example:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * module.run(function($http) {\n     *   $http.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = 'Basic YmVlcDpib29w'\n     * });\n     * ```\n     *\n     * In addition, you can supply a `headers` property in the config object passed when\n     * calling `$http(config)`, which overrides the defaults without changing them globally.\n     *\n     * To explicitly remove a header automatically added via $httpProvider.defaults.headers on a per request basis,\n     * Use the `headers` property, setting the desired header to `undefined`. For example:\n     *\n     * ```js\n     * var req = {\n     *  method: 'POST',\n     *  url: 'http://example.com',\n     *  headers: {\n     *    'Content-Type': undefined\n     *  },\n     *  data: { test: 'test' },\n     * }\n     *\n     * $http(req).success(function(){...}).error(function(){...});\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ## Transforming Requests and Responses\n     *\n     * Both requests and responses can be transformed using transformation functions: `transformRequest`\n     * and `transformResponse`. These properties can be a single function that returns\n     * the transformed value (`function(data, headersGetter, status)`) or an array of such transformation functions,\n     * which allows you to `push` or `unshift` a new transformation function into the transformation chain.\n     *\n     * ### Default Transformations\n     *\n     * The `$httpProvider` provider and `$http` service expose `defaults.transformRequest` and\n     * `defaults.transformResponse` properties. If a request does not provide its own transformations\n     * then these will be applied.\n     *\n     * You can augment or replace the default transformations by modifying these properties by adding to or\n     * replacing the array.\n     *\n     * Angular provides the following default transformations:\n     *\n     * Request transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformRequest` and `$http.defaults.transformRequest`):\n     *\n     * - If the `data` property of the request configuration object contains an object, serialize it\n     *   into JSON format.\n     *\n     * Response transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformResponse` and `$http.defaults.transformResponse`):\n     *\n     *  - If XSRF prefix is detected, strip it (see Security Considerations section below).\n     *  - If JSON response is detected, deserialize it using a JSON parser.\n     *\n     *\n     * ### Overriding the Default Transformations Per Request\n     *\n     * If you wish override the request/response transformations only for a single request then provide\n     * `transformRequest` and/or `transformResponse` properties on the configuration object passed\n     * into `$http`.\n     *\n     * Note that if you provide these properties on the config object the default transformations will be\n     * overwritten. If you wish to augment the default transformations then you must include them in your\n     * local transformation array.\n     *\n     * The following code demonstrates adding a new response transformation to be run after the default response\n     * transformations have been run.\n     *\n     * ```js\n     * function appendTransform(defaults, transform) {\n     *\n     *   // We can't guarantee that the default transformation is an array\n     *   defaults = angular.isArray(defaults) ? defaults : [defaults];\n     *\n     *   // Append the new transformation to the defaults\n     *   return defaults.concat(transform);\n     * }\n     *\n     * $http({\n     *   url: '...',\n     *   method: 'GET',\n     *   transformResponse: appendTransform($http.defaults.transformResponse, function(value) {\n     *     return doTransform(value);\n     *   })\n     * });\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Caching\n     *\n     * To enable caching, set the request configuration `cache` property to `true` (to use default\n     * cache) or to a custom cache object (built with {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}).\n     * When the cache is enabled, `$http` stores the response from the server in the specified\n     * cache. The next time the same request is made, the response is served from the cache without\n     * sending a request to the server.\n     *\n     * Note that even if the response is served from cache, delivery of the data is asynchronous in\n     * the same way that real requests are.\n     *\n     * If there are multiple GET requests for the same URL that should be cached using the same\n     * cache, but the cache is not populated yet, only one request to the server will be made and\n     * the remaining requests will be fulfilled using the response from the first request.\n     *\n     * You can change the default cache to a new object (built with\n     * {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}) by updating the\n     * {@link ng.$http#defaults `$http.defaults.cache`} property. All requests who set\n     * their `cache` property to `true` will now use this cache object.\n     *\n     * If you set the default cache to `false` then only requests that specify their own custom\n     * cache object will be cached.\n     *\n     * ## Interceptors\n     *\n     * Before you start creating interceptors, be sure to understand the\n     * {@link ng.$q $q and deferred/promise APIs}.\n     *\n     * For purposes of global error handling, authentication, or any kind of synchronous or\n     * asynchronous pre-processing of request or postprocessing of responses, it is desirable to be\n     * able to intercept requests before they are handed to the server and\n     * responses before they are handed over to the application code that\n     * initiated these requests. The interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q\n     * promise APIs} to fulfill this need for both synchronous and asynchronous pre-processing.\n     *\n     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the `$httpProvider` by\n     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.interceptors` array. The factory is called and\n     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor.\n     *\n     * There are two kinds of interceptors (and two kinds of rejection interceptors):\n     *\n     *   * `request`: interceptors get called with a http `config` object. The function is free to\n     *     modify the `config` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `config`\n     *     object directly, or a promise containing the `config` or a new `config` object.\n     *   * `requestError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or\n     *     resolved with a rejection.\n     *   * `response`: interceptors get called with http `response` object. The function is free to\n     *     modify the `response` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `response`\n     *     object directly, or as a promise containing the `response` or a new `response` object.\n     *   * `responseError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or\n     *     resolved with a rejection.\n     *\n     *\n     * ```js\n     *   // register the interceptor as a service\n     *   $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {\n     *     return {\n     *       // optional method\n     *       'request': function(config) {\n     *         // do something on success\n     *         return config;\n     *       },\n     *\n     *       // optional method\n     *      'requestError': function(rejection) {\n     *         // do something on error\n     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {\n     *           return responseOrNewPromise\n     *         }\n     *         return $q.reject(rejection);\n     *       },\n     *\n     *\n     *\n     *       // optional method\n     *       'response': function(response) {\n     *         // do something on success\n     *         return response;\n     *       },\n     *\n     *       // optional method\n     *      'responseError': function(rejection) {\n     *         // do something on error\n     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {\n     *           return responseOrNewPromise\n     *         }\n     *         return $q.reject(rejection);\n     *       }\n     *     };\n     *   });\n     *\n     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');\n     *\n     *\n     *   // alternatively, register the interceptor via an anonymous factory\n     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push(function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {\n     *     return {\n     *      'request': function(config) {\n     *          // same as above\n     *       },\n     *\n     *       'response': function(response) {\n     *          // same as above\n     *       }\n     *     };\n     *   });\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ## Security Considerations\n     *\n     * When designing web applications, consider security threats from:\n     *\n     * - [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)\n     * - [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)\n     *\n     * Both server and the client must cooperate in order to eliminate these threats. Angular comes\n     * pre-configured with strategies that address these issues, but for this to work backend server\n     * cooperation is required.\n     *\n     * ### JSON Vulnerability Protection\n     *\n     * A [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)\n     * allows third party website to turn your JSON resource URL into\n     * [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) request under some conditions. To\n     * counter this your server can prefix all JSON requests with following string `\")]}',\\n\"`.\n     * Angular will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.\n     *\n     * For example if your server needs to return:\n     * ```js\n     * ['one','two']\n     * ```\n     *\n     * which is vulnerable to attack, your server can return:\n     * ```js\n     * )]}',\n     * ['one','two']\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Angular will strip the prefix, before processing the JSON.\n     *\n     *\n     * ### Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Protection\n     *\n     * [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) is a technique by which\n     * an unauthorized site can gain your user's private data. Angular provides a mechanism\n     * to counter XSRF. When performing XHR requests, the $http service reads a token from a cookie\n     * (by default, `XSRF-TOKEN`) and sets it as an HTTP header (`X-XSRF-TOKEN`). Since only\n     * JavaScript that runs on your domain could read the cookie, your server can be assured that\n     * the XHR came from JavaScript running on your domain. The header will not be set for\n     * cross-domain requests.\n     *\n     * To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session\n     * cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on the first HTTP GET request. On subsequent XHR requests the\n     * server can verify that the cookie matches `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure\n     * that only JavaScript running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be\n     * unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server (to prevent the JavaScript from\n     * making up its own tokens). We recommend that the token is a digest of your site's\n     * authentication cookie with a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography&#41;)\n     * for added security.\n     *\n     * The name of the headers can be specified using the xsrfHeaderName and xsrfCookieName\n     * properties of either $httpProvider.defaults at config-time, $http.defaults at run-time,\n     * or the per-request config object.\n     *\n     *\n     * @param {object} config Object describing the request to be made and how it should be\n     *    processed. The object has following properties:\n     *\n     *    - **method** – `{string}` – HTTP method (e.g. 'GET', 'POST', etc)\n     *    - **url** – `{string}` – Absolute or relative URL of the resource that is being requested.\n     *    - **params** – `{Object.<string|Object>}` – Map of strings or objects which will be turned\n     *      to `?key1=value1&key2=value2` after the url. If the value is not a string, it will be\n     *      JSONified.\n     *    - **data** – `{string|Object}` – Data to be sent as the request message data.\n     *    - **headers** – `{Object}` – Map of strings or functions which return strings representing\n     *      HTTP headers to send to the server. If the return value of a function is null, the\n     *      header will not be sent.\n     *    - **xsrfHeaderName** – `{string}` – Name of HTTP header to populate with the XSRF token.\n     *    - **xsrfCookieName** – `{string}` – Name of cookie containing the XSRF token.\n     *    - **transformRequest** –\n     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –\n     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n     *      request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.\n     *      See {@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request\n     *      Overriding the Default Transformations}\n     *    - **transformResponse** –\n     *      `{function(data, headersGetter, status)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter, status)>}` –\n     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n     *      response body, headers and status and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.\n     *      See {@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request\n     *      Overriding the Default Transformations}\n     *    - **cache** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the\n     *      GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with\n     *      {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory}, this cache will be used for\n     *      caching.\n     *    - **timeout** – `{number|Promise}` – timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise}\n     *      that should abort the request when resolved.\n     *    - **withCredentials** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the\n     *      XHR object. See [requests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Requests_with_credentials)\n     *      for more information.\n     *    - **responseType** - `{string}` - see\n     *      [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).\n     *\n     * @returns {HttpPromise} Returns a {@link ng.$q promise} object with the\n     *   standard `then` method and two http specific methods: `success` and `error`. The `then`\n     *   method takes two arguments a success and an error callback which will be called with a\n     *   response object. The `success` and `error` methods take a single argument - a function that\n     *   will be called when the request succeeds or fails respectively. The arguments passed into\n     *   these functions are destructured representation of the response object passed into the\n     *   `then` method. The response object has these properties:\n     *\n     *   - **data** – `{string|Object}` – The response body transformed with the transform\n     *     functions.\n     *   - **status** – `{number}` – HTTP status code of the response.\n     *   - **headers** – `{function([headerName])}` – Header getter function.\n     *   - **config** – `{Object}` – The configuration object that was used to generate the request.\n     *   - **statusText** – `{string}` – HTTP status text of the response.\n     *\n     * @property {Array.<Object>} pendingRequests Array of config objects for currently pending\n     *   requests.

Start and end markers\n     * can be escaped by preceding each of their characters with a REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash).\n     * It will be rendered as a regular start/end marker, and will not be interpreted as an expression\n     * or binding.\n     *\n     * This enables web-servers to prevent script injection attacks and defacing attacks, to some\n     * degree, while also enabling code examples to work without relying on the\n     * {@link ng.directive:ngNonBindable ngNonBindable} directive.\n     *\n     * **For security purposes, it is strongly encouraged that web servers escape user-supplied data,\n     * replacing angle brackets (&lt;, &gt;) with &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; respectively, and replacing all\n     * interpolation start/end markers with their escaped counterparts.**\n     *\n     * Escaped interpolation markers are only replaced with the actual interpolation markers in rendered\n     * output when the $interpolate service processes the text. So, for HTML elements interpolated\n     * by {@link ng.$compile $compile}, or otherwise interpolated with the `mustHaveExpression` parameter\n     * set to `true`, the interpolated text must contain an unescaped interpolation expression. As such,\n     * this is typically useful only when user-data is used in rendering a template from the server, or\n     * when otherwise untrusted data is used by a directive.\n     *\n     * <example>\n     *  <file name=\"index.html\">\n     *    <div ng-init=\"username='A user'\">\n     *      <p ng-init=\"apptitle='Escaping demo'\">{{apptitle}}: \\{\\{ username = \"defaced value\"; \\}\\}\n     *        </p>\n     *      <p><strong>{{username}}</strong> attempts to inject code which will deface the\n     *        application, but fails to accomplish their task, because the server has correctly\n     *        escaped the interpolation start/end markers with REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash)\n     *        characters.</p>\n     *      <p>Instead, the result of the attempted script injection is visible, and can be removed\n     *        from the database by an administrator.</p>\n     *    </div>\n     *  </file>\n     * </example>\n     *\n     * @param {string} text The text with markup to interpolate.\n     * @param {boolean=} mustHaveExpression if set to true then the interpolation string must have\n     *    embedded expression in order to return an interpolation function.

However, one can obtain the ability to execute arbitrary JS code by\n// obtaining a reference to native JS functions such as the Function constructor.\n//\n// As an example, consider the following Angular expression:\n//\n//   {}.toString.constructor('alert(\"evil JS code\")')\n//\n// This sandboxing technique is not perfect and doesn't aim to be. The goal is to prevent exploits\n// against the expression language, but not to prevent exploits that were enabled by exposing\n// sensitive JavaScript or browser APIs on Scope. Exposing such objects on a Scope is never a good\n// practice and therefore we are not even trying to protect against interaction with an object\n// explicitly exposed in this way.\n//\n// In general, it is not possible to access a Window object from an angular expression unless a\n// window or some DOM object that has a reference to window is published onto a Scope.\n// Similarly we prevent invocations of function known to be dangerous, as well as assignments to\n// native objects.\n//\n// See https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/security\n\n\nfunction ensureSafeMemberName(name, fullExpression) {\n  if (name === \"__defineGetter__\" || name === \"__defineSetter__\"\n      || name === \"__lookupGetter__\" || name === \"__lookupSetter__\"\n      || name === \"__proto__\") {\n    throw $parseMinErr('isecfld',\n        'Attempting to access a disallowed field in Angular expressions!

This is similar to the native Promise implementation from ES6 Harmony,\n * see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).\n *\n * While the constructor-style use is supported, not all of the supporting methods from ES6 Harmony promises are\n * available yet.\n *\n * It can be used like so:\n *\n * ```js\n *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`\n *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).\n *\n *   function asyncGreet(name) {\n *     // perform some asynchronous operation, resolve or reject the promise when appropriate.\n *     return $q(function(resolve, reject) {\n *       setTimeout(function() {\n *         if (okToGreet(name)) {\n *           resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');\n *         } else {\n *           reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');\n *         }\n *       }, 1000);\n *     });\n *   }\n *\n *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');\n *   promise.then(function(greeting) {\n *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);\n *   }, function(reason) {\n *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);\n *   });\n * ```\n *\n * Note: progress/notify callbacks are not currently supported via the ES6-style interface.\n *\n * However, the more traditional CommonJS-style usage is still available, and documented below.\n *\n * [The CommonJS Promise proposal](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) describes a promise as an\n * interface for interacting with an object that represents the result of an action that is\n * performed asynchronously, and may or may not be finished at any given point in time.\n *\n * From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise APIs are to\n * asynchronous programming what `try`, `catch` and `throw` keywords are to synchronous programming.\n *\n * ```js\n *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`\n *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).\n *\n *   function asyncGreet(name) {\n *     var deferred = $q.defer();\n *\n *     setTimeout(function() {\n *       deferred.notify('About to greet ' + name + '.');\n *\n *       if (okToGreet(name)) {\n *         deferred.resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');\n *       } else {\n *         deferred.reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');\n *       }\n *     }, 1000);\n *\n *     return deferred.promise;\n *   }\n *\n *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');\n *   promise.then(function(greeting) {\n *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);\n *   }, function(reason) {\n *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);\n *   }, function(update) {\n *     alert('Got notification: ' + update);\n *   });\n * ```\n *\n * At first it might not be obvious why this extra complexity is worth the trouble. The payoff\n * comes in the way of guarantees that promise and deferred APIs make, see\n * https://github.com/kriskowal/uncommonjs/blob/master/promises/specification.md.\n *\n * Additionally the promise api allows for composition that is very hard to do with the\n * traditional callback ([CPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)) approach.\n * For more on this please see the [Q documentation](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) especially the\n * section on serial or parallel joining of promises.\n *\n * # The Deferred API\n *\n * A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling `$q.defer()`.\n *\n * The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance as well as APIs\n * that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion, as well as the status\n * of the task.\n *\n * **Methods**\n *\n * - `resolve(value)` – resolves the derived promise with the `value`. If the value is a rejection\n *   constructed via `$q.reject`, the promise will be rejected instead.\n * - `reject(reason)` – rejects the derived promise with the `reason`. This is equivalent to\n *   resolving it with a rejection constructed via `$q.reject`.\n * - `notify(value)` - provides updates on the status of the promise's execution. This may be called\n *   multiple times before the promise is either resolved or rejected.\n *\n * **Properties**\n *\n * - promise – `{Promise}` – promise object associated with this deferred.\n *\n *\n * # The Promise API\n *\n * A new promise instance is created when a deferred instance is created and can be retrieved by\n * calling `deferred.promise`.\n *\n * The purpose of the promise object is to allow for interested parties to get access to the result\n * of the deferred task when it completes.\n *\n * **Methods**\n *\n * - `then(successCallback, errorCallback, notifyCallback)` – regardless of when the promise was or\n *   will be resolved or rejected, `then` calls one of the success or error callbacks asynchronously\n *   as soon as the result is available. The callbacks are called with a single argument: the result\n *   or rejection reason. Additionally, the notify callback may be called zero or more times to\n *   provide a progress indication, before the promise is resolved or rejected.\n *\n *   This method *returns a new promise* which is resolved or rejected via the return value of the\n *   `successCallback`, `errorCallback`. It also notifies via the return value of the\n *   `notifyCallback` method. The promise cannot be resolved or rejected from the notifyCallback\n *   method.\n *\n * - `catch(errorCallback)` – shorthand for `promise.then(null, errorCallback)`\n *\n * - `finally(callback, notifyCallback)` – allows you to observe either the fulfillment or rejection of a promise,\n *   but to do so without modifying the final value. This is useful to release resources or do some\n *   clean-up that needs to be done whether the promise was rejected or resolved. See the [full\n *   specification](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promisefinallycallback) for\n *   more information.\n *\n * # Chaining promises\n *\n * Because calling the `then` method of a promise returns a new derived promise, it is easily\n * possible to create a chain of promises:\n *\n * ```js\n *   promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {\n *     return result + 1;\n *   });\n *\n *   // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value\n *   // will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1\n * ```\n *\n * It is possible to create chains of any length and since a promise can be resolved with another\n * promise (which will defer its resolution further), it is possible to pause/defer resolution of\n * the promises at any point in the chain. This makes it possible to implement powerful APIs like\n * $http's response interceptors.\n *\n *\n * # Differences between Kris Kowal's Q and $q\n *\n *  There are two main differences:\n *\n * - $q is integrated with the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope} Scope model observation\n *   mechanism in angular, which means faster propagation of resolution or rejection into your\n *   models and avoiding unnecessary browser repaints, which would result in flickering UI.\n * - Q has many more features than $q, but that comes at a cost of bytes. $q is tiny, but contains\n *   all the important functionality needed for common async tasks.\n *\n *  # Testing\n *\n *  ```js\n *    it('should simulate promise', inject(function($q, $rootScope) {\n *      var deferred = $q.defer();\n *      var promise = deferred.promise;\n *      var resolvedValue;\n *\n *      promise.then(function(value) { resolvedValue = value; });\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();\n *\n *      // Simulate resolving of promise\n *      deferred.resolve(123);\n *      // Note that the 'then' function does not get called synchronously.\n *      // This is because we want the promise API to always be async, whether or not\n *      // it got called synchronously or asynchronously.\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();\n *\n *      // Propagate promise resolution to 'then' functions using $apply().\n *      $rootScope.$apply();\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toEqual(123);\n *    }));\n *  ```\n *\n * @param {function(function, function)} resolver Function which is responsible for resolving or\n *   rejecting the newly created promise.

One example of\n * such a context is binding arbitrary html controlled by the user via `ng-bind-html`.  We refer\n * to these contexts as privileged or SCE contexts.\n *\n * As of version 1.2, Angular ships with SCE enabled by default.\n *\n * Note:  When enabled (the default), IE<11 in quirks mode is not supported.  In this mode, IE<11 allow\n * one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use of the expression() syntax.  Refer\n * <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx> to learn more about them.\n * You can ensure your document is in standards mode and not quirks mode by adding `<!doctype html>`\n * to the top of your HTML document.\n *\n * SCE assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b) makes auditing for\n * security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.\n *\n * Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:\n *\n * ```\n * <input ng-model=\"userHtml\">\n * <div ng-bind-html=\"userHtml\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that `ng-bind-html` is bound to `userHtml` controlled by the user.  With SCE\n * disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary HTML into the DIV.\n * In a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via\n * bindings.  (HTML is just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input creates\n * security vulnerabilities.)\n *\n * For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,\n * to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.\n *\n * How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that\n * was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you\n * ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some\n * properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?\n *\n * To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can\n * determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that\n * context.  You can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done\n * for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server,\n * sanitized by your library, etc.  You can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps\n * allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.  Ensuring that the internal API\n * exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task.\n *\n * In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses {@link ng.$sce#trustAs $sce.trustAs}\n * (and shorthand methods such as {@link ng.$sce#trustAsHtml $sce.trustAsHtml}, etc.) to\n * obtain values that will be accepted by SCE / privileged contexts.\n *\n *\n * ## How does it work?\n *\n * In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted\n * $sce.getTrusted(context, value)} rather than to the value directly.  Directives use {@link\n * ng.$sce#parseAs $sce.parseAs} rather than `$parse` to watch attribute bindings, which performs the\n * {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted} behind the scenes on non-constant literals.\n *\n * As an example, {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} uses {@link\n * ng.$sce#parseAsHtml $sce.parseAsHtml(binding expression)}.  Here's the actual code (slightly\n * simplified):\n *\n * ```\n * var ngBindHtmlDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {\n *   return function(scope, element, attr) {\n *     scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtml), function(value) {\n *       element.html(value || '');\n *     });\n *   };\n * }];\n * ```\n *\n * ## Impact on loading templates\n *\n * This applies both to the {@link ng.directive:ngInclude `ng-include`} directive as well as\n * `templateUrl`'s specified by {@link guide/directive directives}.\n *\n * By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and protocol as the application\n * document.  This is done by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl\n * $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL.  To load templates from other domains and/or\n * protocols, you may either either {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist\n * them} or {@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap it} into a trusted value.\n *\n * *Please note*:\n * The browser's\n * [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)\n * and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)\n * policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether the template is successfully\n * loaded.  This means that without the right CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain\n * won't work on all browsers.  Also, loading templates from `file://` URL does not work on some\n * browsers.\n *\n * ## This feels like too much overhead\n *\n * It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.\n *\n * If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted and you don't need to\n * call `$sce.trustAs` on them (remember to include the `ngSanitize` module) (e.g.\n * `<div ng-bind-html=\"'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'\"></div>`) just works.\n *\n * Additionally, `a[href]` and `img[src]` automatically sanitize their URLs and do not pass them\n * through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted}.  SCE doesn't play a role here.\n *\n * The included {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} comes with sane defaults to allow you to load\n * templates in `ng-include` from your application's domain without having to even know about SCE.\n * It blocks loading templates from other domains or loading templates over http from an https\n * served document.  You can change these by setting your own custom {@link\n * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelists} and {@link\n * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist blacklists} for matching such URLs.\n *\n * This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the small overhead and have an\n * application that's secure and can be audited to verify that with much more ease than bolting\n * security onto an application later.\n *\n * <a name=\"contexts\"></a>\n * ## What trusted context types are supported?\n *\n * | Context             | Notes          |\n * |---------------------|----------------|\n * | `$sce.HTML`         | For HTML that's safe to source into the application.  The {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} directive uses this context for bindings. If an unsafe value is encountered and the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize} module is present this will sanitize the value instead of throwing an error. |\n * | `$sce.CSS`          | For CSS that's safe to source into the application.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |\n * | `$sce.URL`          | For URLs that are safe to follow as links.  Currently unused (`<a href=` and `<img src=` sanitize their urls and don't constitute an SCE context. |\n * | `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` | For URLs that are not only safe to follow as links, but whose contents are also safe to include in your application.  Examples include `ng-include`, `src` / `ngSrc` bindings for tags other than `IMG` (e.g. `IFRAME`, `OBJECT`, etc.)  <br><br>Note that `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.URL` does and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.URL` are required. |\n * | `$sce.JS`           | For JavaScript that is safe to execute in your application's context.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |\n *\n * ## Format of items in {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist resourceUrlWhitelist}/{@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist Blacklist} <a name=\"resourceUrlPatternItem\"></a>\n *\n *  Each element in these arrays must be one of the following:\n *\n *  - **'self'**\n *    - The special **string**, `'self'`, can be used to match against all URLs of the **same\n *      domain** as the application document using the **same protocol**.\n *  - **String** (except the special value `'self'`)\n *    - The string is matched against the full *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource\n *      being tested (substring matches are not good enough.)\n *    - There are exactly **two wildcard sequences** - `*` and `**`.  All other characters\n *      match themselves.\n *    - `*`: matches zero or more occurrences of any character other than one of the following 6\n *      characters: '`:`', '`/`', '`.`', '`?`', '`&`' and ';'.  It's a useful wildcard for use\n *      in a whitelist.\n *    - `**`: matches zero or more occurrences of *any* character.  As such, it's not\n *      not appropriate to use in for a scheme, domain, etc. as it would match too much.  (e.g.\n *      http://**.example.com/ would match http://evil.com/?ignore=.example.com/ and that might\n *      not have been the intention.)  Its usage at the very end of the path is ok.  (e.g.\n *      http://foo.example.com/templates/**).\n *  - **RegExp** (*see caveat below*)\n *    - *Caveat*:  While regular expressions are powerful and offer great flexibility,  their syntax\n *      (and all the inevitable escaping) makes them *harder to maintain*.  It's easy to\n *      accidentally introduce a bug when one updates a complex expression (imho, all regexes should\n *      have good test coverage.).  For instance, the use of `.` in the regex is correct only in a\n *      small number of cases.  A `.` character in the regex used when matching the scheme or a\n *      subdomain could be matched against a `:` or literal `.` that was likely not intended.   It\n *      is highly recommended to use the string patterns and only fall back to regular expressions\n *      if they as a last resort.\n *    - The regular expression must be an instance of RegExp (i.e. not a string.)  It is\n *      matched against the **entire** *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource being tested\n *      (even when the RegExp did not have the `^` and `$` codes.)  In addition, any flags\n *      present on the RegExp (such as multiline, global, ignoreCase) are ignored.\n *    - If you are generating your JavaScript from some other templating engine (not\n *      recommended, e.g. in issue [#4006](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4006)),\n *      remember to escape your regular expression (and be aware that you might need more than\n *      one level of escaping depending on your templating engine and the way you interpolated\n *      the value.)  Do make use of your platform's escaping mechanism as it might be good\n *      enough before coding your own.  e.g. Ruby has\n *      [Regexp.escape(str)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Regexp.html#method-c-escape)\n *      and Python has [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape).\n *      Javascript lacks a similar built in function for escaping.  Take a look at Google\n *      Closure library's [goog.string.regExpEscape(s)](\n *      http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_string_string.js.source.html#line962).\n *\n * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} for an example.\n *\n * ## Show me an example using SCE.\n *\n * <example module=\"mySceApp\" deps=\"angular-sanitize.js\">\n * <file name=\"index.html\">\n *   <div ng-controller=\"AppController as myCtrl\">\n *     <i ng-bind-html=\"myCtrl.explicitlyTrustedHtml\" id=\"explicitlyTrustedHtml\"></i><br><br>\n *     <b>User comments</b><br>\n *     By default, HTML that isn't explicitly trusted (e.g. Alice's comment) is sanitized when\n *     $sanitize is available.

However, this is strongly discouraged.  SCE gives you a lot of security benefits\n * for little coding overhead.  It will be much harder to take an SCE disabled application and\n * either secure it on your own or enable SCE at a later stage.  It might make sense to disable SCE\n * for cases where you have a lot of existing code that was written before SCE was introduced and\n * you're migrating them a module at a time.\n *\n * That said, here's how you can completely disable SCE:\n *\n * ```\n * angular.module('myAppWithSceDisabledmyApp', []).config(function($sceProvider) {\n *   // Completely disable SCE.  For demonstration purposes only!\n *   // Do not use in new projects.\n *   $sceProvider.enabled(false);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n */\n/* jshint maxlen: 100 */\n\nfunction $SceProvider() {\n  var enabled = true;\n\n  /**\n   * @ngdoc method\n   * @name $sceProvider#enabled\n   * @kind function\n   *\n   * @param {boolean=} value If provided, then enables/disables SCE.\n   * @return {boolean} true if SCE is enabled, false otherwise.\n   *\n   * @description\n   * Enables/disables SCE and returns the current value.\n   */\n  this.enabled = function(value) {\n    if (arguments.length) {\n      enabled = !!value;\n    }\n    return enabled;\n  };\n\n\n  /* Design notes on the default implementation for SCE.\n   *\n   * The API contract for the SCE delegate\n   * -------------------------------------\n   * The SCE delegate object must provide the following 3 methods:\n   *\n   * - trustAs(contextEnum, value)\n   *     This method is used to tell the SCE service that the provided value is OK to use in the\n   *     contexts specified by contextEnum.  It must return an object that will be accepted by\n   *     getTrusted() for a compatible contextEnum and return this value.\n   *\n   * - valueOf(value)\n   *     For values that were not produced by trustAs(), return them as is.  For values that were\n   *     produced by trustAs(), return the corresponding input value to trustAs.  Basically, if\n   *     trustAs is wrapping the given values into some type, this operation unwraps it when given\n   *     such a value.\n   *\n   * - getTrusted(contextEnum, value)\n   *     This function should return the a value that is safe to use in the context specified by\n   *     contextEnum or throw and exception otherwise.\n   *\n   * NOTE: This contract deliberately does NOT state that values returned by trustAs() must be\n   * opaque or wrapped in some holder object.  That happens to be an implementation detail.  For\n   * instance, an implementation could maintain a registry of all trusted objects by context.  In\n   * such a case, trustAs() would return the same object that was passed in.  getTrusted() would\n   * return the same object passed in if it was found in the registry under a compatible context or\n   * throw an exception otherwise.  An implementation might only wrap values some of the time based\n   * on some criteria.  getTrusted() might return a value and not throw an exception for special\n   * constants or objects even if not wrapped.  All such implementations fulfill this contract.\n   *\n   *\n   * A note on the inheritance model for SCE contexts\n   * ------------------------------------------------\n   * I've used inheritance and made RESOURCE_URL wrapped types a subtype of URL wrapped types.  This\n   * is purely an implementation details.\n   *\n   * The contract is simply this:\n   *\n   *     getTrusted($sce.RESOURCE_URL, value) succeeding implies that getTrusted($sce.URL, value)\n   *     will also succeed.\n   *\n   * Inheritance happens to capture this in a natural way.  In some future, we\n   * may not use inheritance anymore.  That is OK because no code outside of\n   * sce.js and sceSpecs.js would need to be aware of this detail.\n   */\n\n  this.$get = ['$parse', '$sceDelegate', function(\n                $parse,   $sceDelegate) {\n    // Prereq: Ensure that we're not running in IE<11 quirks mode.

Normalizing means that a relative\n * URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.\n * Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related\n * properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide\n * compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+, Opera 7+,e etc.  See\n * http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html\n *\n * Implementation Notes for IE\n * ---------------------------\n * IE >= 8 and <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other\n * browsers.  However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify\n * them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = \"foo\", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We\n * work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized\n * URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.  This correctly populates the\n * properties such as protocol, hostname, port, etc.\n *\n * IE7 does not normalize the URL when assigned to an anchor node.  (Apparently, it does, if one\n * uses the inner HTML approach to assign the URL as part of an HTML snippet -\n * http://stackoverflow.com/a/472729)  However, setting img[src] does normalize the URL.\n * Unfortunately, setting img[src] to something like \"javascript:foo\" on IE throws an exception.\n * Since the primary usage for normalizing URLs is to sanitize such URLs, we can't use that\n * method and IE < 8 is unsupported.\n *\n * References:\n *   http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement\n *   http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html\n *   http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#urlutils\n *   https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/2902\n *   http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/parsing-urls-with-the-dom/\n *\n * @kind function\n * @param {string} url The URL to be parsed.\n * @description Normalizes and parses a URL.\n * @returns {object} Returns the normalized URL as a dictionary.\n *\n *   | member name   | Description    |\n *   |---------------|----------------|\n *   | href          | A normalized version of the provided URL if it was not an absolute URL |\n *   | protocol      | The protocol including the trailing colon                              |\n *   | host          | The host and port (if the port is non-default) of the normalizedUrl    |\n *   | search        | The search params, minus the question mark                             |\n *   | hash          | The hash string, minus the hash symbol\n *   | hostname      | The hostname\n *   | port          | The port, without \":\"\n *   | pathname      | The pathname, beginning with \"/\"\n *\n */\nfunction urlResolve(url) {\n  var href = url;\n\n  if (msie) {\n    // Normalize before parse.

To achieve this a filter definition consists of a factory function which is\n * annotated with dependencies and is responsible for creating a filter function.\n *\n * ```js\n *   // Filter registration\n *   function MyModule($provide, $filterProvider) {\n *     // create a service to demonstrate injection (not always needed)\n *     $provide.value('greet', function(name){\n *       return 'Hello ' + name + '!';\n *     });\n *\n *     // register a filter factory which uses the\n *     // greet service to demonstrate DI.\n *     $filterProvider.register('greet', function(greet){\n *       // return the filter function which uses the greet service\n *       // to generate salutation\n *       return function(text) {\n *         // filters need to be forgiving so check input validity\n *         return text && greet(text) || text;\n *       };\n *     });\n *   }\n * ```\n *\n * The filter function is registered with the `$injector` under the filter name suffix with\n * `Filter`.\n *\n * ```js\n *   it('should be the same instance', inject(\n *     function($filterProvider) {\n *       $filterProvider.register('reverse', function(){\n *         return ...;\n *       });\n *     },\n *     function($filter, reverseFilter) {\n *       expect($filter('reverse')).toBe(reverseFilter);\n *     });\n * ```\n *\n *\n * For more information about how angular filters work, and how to create your own filters, see\n * {@link guide/filter Filters} in the Angular Developer Guide.\n */\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc service\n * @name $filter\n * @kind function\n * @description\n * Filters are used for formatting data displayed to the user.\n *\n * The general syntax in templates is as follows:\n *\n *         {{ expression [| filter_name[:parameter_value] ... ] }}\n *\n * @param {String} name Name of the filter function to retrieve\n * @return {Function} the filter function\n * @example\n   <example name=\"$filter\" module=\"filterExample\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <div ng-controller=\"MainCtrl\">\n        <h3>{{ originalText }}</h3>\n        <h3>{{ filteredText }}</h3>\n       </div>\n     </file>\n\n     <file name=\"script.js\">\n      angular.module('filterExample', [])\n      .controller('MainCtrl', function($scope, $filter) {\n        $scope.originalText = 'hello';\n        $scope.filteredText = $filter('uppercase')($scope.originalText);\n      });\n     </file>\n   </example>\n  */\n$FilterProvider.$inject = ['$provide'];\nfunction $FilterProvider($provide) {\n  var suffix = 'Filter';\n\n  /**\n   * @ngdoc method\n   * @name $filterProvider#register\n   * @param {string|Object} name Name of the filter function, or an object map of filters where\n   *    the keys are the filter names and the values are the filter factories.\n   * @returns {Object} Registered filter instance, or if a map of filters was provided then a map\n   *    of the registered filter instances.\n   */\n  function register(name, factory) {\n    if (isObject(name)) {\n      var filters = {};\n      forEach(name, function(filter, key) {\n        filters[key] = register(key, filter);\n      });\n      return filters;\n    } else {\n      return $provide.factory(name + suffix, factory);\n    }\n  }\n  this.register = register;\n\n  this.$get = ['$injector', function($injector) {\n    return function(name) {\n      return $injector.get(name + suffix);\n    };\n  }];\n\n  ////////////////////////////////////////\n\n  /* global\n    currencyFilter: false,\n    dateFilter: false,\n    filterFilter: false,\n    jsonFilter: false,\n    limitToFilter: false,\n    lowercaseFilter: false,\n    numberFilter: false,\n    orderByFilter: false,\n    uppercaseFilter: false,\n  */\n\n  register('currency', currencyFilter);\n  register('date', dateFilter);\n  register('filter', filterFilter);\n  register('json', jsonFilter);\n  register('limitTo', limitToFilter);\n  register('lowercase', lowercaseFilter);\n  register('number', numberFilter);\n  register('orderBy', orderByFilter);\n  register('uppercase', uppercaseFilter);\n}\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc filter\n * @name filter\n * @kind function\n *\n * @description\n * Selects a subset of items from `array` and returns it as a new array.\n *\n * @param {Array} array The source array.\n * @param {string|Object|function()} expression The predicate to be used for selecting items from\n *   `array`.\n *\n *   Can be one of:\n *\n *   - `string`: The string is used for matching against the contents of the `array`. All strings or\n *     objects with string properties in `array` that match this string will be returned. This also\n *     applies to nested object properties.\n *     The predicate can be negated by prefixing the string with `!`.\n *\n *   - `Object`: A pattern object can be used to filter specific properties on objects contained\n *     by `array`. For example `{name:\"M\", phone:\"1\"}` predicate will return an array of items\n *     which have property `name` containing \"M\" and property `phone` containing \"1\". A special\n *     property name `$` can be used (as in `{$:\"text\"}`) to accept a match against any\n *     property of the object or its nested object properties. That's equivalent to the simple\n *     substring match with a `string` as described above. The predicate can be negated by prefixing\n *     the string with `!`.\n *     For example `{name: \"!M\"}` predicate will return an array of items which have property `name`\n *     not containing \"M\".\n *\n *     Note that a named property will match properties on the same level only, while the special\n *     `$` property will match properties on the same level or deeper. E.g. an array item like\n *     `{name: {first: 'John', last: 'Doe'}}` will **not** be matched by `{name: 'John'}`, but\n *     **will** be matched by `{$: 'John'}`.\n *\n *   - `function(value, index)`: A predicate function can be used to write arbitrary filters. The\n *     function is called for each element of `array`. The final result is an array of those\n *     elements that the predicate returned true for.\n *\n * @param {function(actual, expected)|true|undefined} comparator Comparator which is used in\n *     determining if the expected value (from the filter expression) and actual value (from\n *     the object in the array) should be considered a match.\n *\n *   Can be one of:\n *\n *   - `function(actual, expected)`:\n *     The function will be given the object value and the predicate value to compare and\n *     should return true if both values should be considered equal.\n *\n *   - `true`: A shorthand for `function(actual, expected) { return angular.equals(actual, expected)}`.\n *     This is essentially strict comparison of expected and actual.\n *\n *   - `false|undefined`: A short hand for a function which will look for a substring match in case\n *     insensitive way.\n *\n * @example\n   <example>\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <div ng-init=\"friends =

It is ordered alphabetically\n * for strings and numerically for numbers. Note: if you notice numbers are not being sorted\n * correctly, make sure they are actually being saved as numbers and not strings.\n *\n * @param {Array} array The array to sort.\n * @param {function(*)|string|Array.<(function(*)|string)>=} expression A predicate to be\n *    used by the comparator to determine the order of elements.\n *\n *    Can be one of:\n *\n *    - `function`: Getter function. The result of this function will be sorted using the\n *      `<`, `=`, `>` operator.\n *    - `string`: An Angular expression. The result of this expression is used to compare elements\n *      (for example `name` to sort by a property called `name` or `name.substr(0, 3)` to sort by\n *      3 first characters of a property called `name`). The result of a constant expression\n *      is interpreted as a property name to be used in comparisons (for example `\"special name\"`\n *      to sort object by the value of their `special name` property). An expression can be\n *      optionally prefixed with `+` or `-` to control ascending or descending sort order\n *      (for example, `+name` or `-name`). If no property is provided, (e.g. `'+'`) then the array\n *      element itself is used to compare where sorting.\n *    - `Array`: An array of function or string predicates. The first predicate in the array\n *      is used for sorting, but when two items are equivalent, the next predicate is used.\n *\n *    If the predicate is missing or empty then it defaults to `'+'`.\n *\n * @param {boolean=} reverse Reverse the order of the array.\n * @returns {Array} Sorted copy of the source array.\n *\n * @example\n   <example module=\"orderByExample\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <script>\n         angular.module('orderByExample', [])\n           .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n             $scope.friends =\n                 [{name:'John', phone:'555-1212', age:10},\n                  {name:'Mary', phone:'555-9876', age:19},\n                  {name:'Mike', phone:'555-4321', age:21},\n                  {name:'Adam', phone:'555-5678', age:35},\n                  {name:'Julie', phone:'555-8765', age:29}];\n             $scope.predicate = '-age';\n           }]);\n       </script>\n       <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n         <pre>Sorting predicate = {{predicate}}; reverse = {{reverse}}</pre>\n         <hr/>\n         [ <a href=\"\" ng-click=\"predicate=''\">unsorted</a> ]\n         <table class=\"friend\">\n           <tr>\n             <th><a href=\"\" ng-click=\"predicate = 'name'; reverse=false\">Name</a>\n                 (<a href=\"\" ng-click=\"predicate = '-name'; reverse=false\">^</a>)</th>\n             <th><a href=\"\" ng-click=\"predicate = 'phone'; reverse=!reverse\">Phone Number</a></th>\n             <th><a href=\"\" ng-click=\"predicate = 'age'; reverse=!reverse\">Age</a></th>\n           </tr>\n           <tr ng-repeat=\"friend in friends | orderBy:predicate:reverse\">\n             <td>{{friend.name}}</td>\n             <td>{{friend.phone}}</td>\n             <td>{{friend.age}}</td>\n           </tr>\n         </table>\n       </div>\n     </file>\n   </example>\n *\n * It's also possible to call the orderBy filter manually, by injecting `$filter`, retrieving the\n * filter routine with `$filter('orderBy')`, and calling the returned filter routine with the\n * desired parameters.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n * @example\n  <example module=\"orderByExample\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n        <table class=\"friend\">\n          <tr>\n            <th><a href=\"\" ng-click=\"reverse=false;order('name', false)\">Name</a>\n              (<a href=\"\" ng-click=\"order('-name',false)\">^</a>)</th>\n            <th><a href=\"\" ng-click=\"reverse=!reverse;order('phone', reverse)\">Phone Number</a></th>\n            <th><a href=\"\" ng-click=\"reverse=!reverse;order('age',reverse)\">Age</a></th>\n          </tr>\n          <tr ng-repeat=\"friend in friends\">\n            <td>{{friend.name}}</td>\n            <td>{{friend.phone}}</td>\n            <td>{{friend.age}}</td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n    </file>\n\n    <file name=\"script.js\">\n      angular.module('orderByExample', [])\n        .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', '$filter', function($scope, $filter) {\n          var orderBy = $filter('orderBy');\n          $scope.friends = [\n            { name: 'John',    phone: '555-1212',    age: 10 },\n            { name: 'Mary',    phone: '555-9876',    age: 19 },\n            { name: 'Mike',    phone: '555-4321',    age: 21 },\n            { name: 'Adam',    phone: '555-5678',    age: 35 },\n            { name: 'Julie',   phone: '555-8765',    age: 29 }\n          ];\n          $scope.order = function(predicate, reverse) {\n            $scope.friends = orderBy($scope.friends, predicate, reverse);\n          };\n          $scope.order('-age',false);\n        }]);\n    </file>\n</example>\n */\norderByFilter.$inject = ['$parse'];\nfunction orderByFilter($parse) {\n  return function(array, sortPredicate, reverseOrder) {\n    if (!(isArrayLike(array))) return array;\n    sortPredicate = isArray(sortPredicate) ?

This means that the outer form is valid when all of the child\n * forms are valid as well. However, browsers do not allow nesting of `<form>` elements, so\n * Angular provides the {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`} directive which behaves identically to\n * `<form>` but can be nested.  This allows you to have nested forms, which is very useful when\n * using Angular validation directives in forms that are dynamically generated using the\n * {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat`} directive. Since you cannot dynamically generate the `name`\n * attribute of input elements using interpolation, you have to wrap each set of repeated inputs in an\n * `ngForm` directive and nest these in an outer `form` element.\n *\n *\n * # CSS classes\n *  - `ng-valid` is set if the form is valid.\n *  - `ng-invalid` is set if the form is invalid.\n *  - `ng-pristine` is set if the form is pristine.\n *  - `ng-dirty` is set if the form is dirty.\n *  - `ng-submitted` is set if the form was submitted.\n *\n * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.\n *\n *\n * # Submitting a form and preventing the default action\n *\n * Since the role of forms in client-side Angular applications is different than in classical\n * roundtrip apps, it is desirable for the browser not to translate the form submission into a full\n * page reload that sends the data to the server. Instead some javascript logic should be triggered\n * to handle the form submission in an application-specific way.\n *\n * For this reason, Angular prevents the default action (form submission to the server) unless the\n * `<form>` element has an `action` attribute specified.\n *\n * You can use one of the following two ways to specify what javascript method should be called when\n * a form is submitted:\n *\n * - {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit} directive on the form element\n * - {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directive on the first\n  *  button or input field of type submit (input[type=submit])\n *\n * To prevent double execution of the handler, use only one of the {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit}\n * or {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directives.\n * This is because of the following form submission rules in the HTML specification:\n *\n * - If a form has only one input field then hitting enter in this field triggers form submit\n * (`ngSubmit`)\n * - if a form has 2+ input fields and no buttons or input[type=submit] then hitting enter\n * doesn't trigger submit\n * - if a form has one or more input fields and one or more buttons or input[type=submit] then\n * hitting enter in any of the input fields will trigger the click handler on the *first* button or\n * input[type=submit] (`ngClick`) *and* a submit handler on the enclosing form (`ngSubmit`)\n *\n * Any pending `ngModelOptions` changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is\n * submitted. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`\n * to have access to the updated model.\n *\n * ## Animation Hooks\n *\n * Animations in ngForm are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed.\n * These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`, `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any\n * other validations that are performed within the form. Animations in ngForm are similar to how\n * they work in ngClass and animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well\n * as JS animations.\n *\n * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style a form element\n * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:\n *\n * <pre>\n * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more\n * //advanced animations\n * .my-form {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   background: white;\n * }\n * .my-form.ng-invalid {\n *   background: red;\n *   color:white;\n * }\n * </pre>\n *\n * @example\n    <example deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\" fixBase=\"true\" module=\"formExample\">\n      <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <script>\n         angular.module('formExample', [])\n           .controller('FormController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n             $scope.userType = 'guest';\n           }]);\n       </script>\n       <style>\n        .my-form {\n          -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;\n          transition:all linear 0.5s;\n          background: transparent;\n        }\n        .my-form.ng-invalid {\n          background: red;\n        }\n       </style>\n       <form name=\"myForm\" ng-controller=\"FormController\" class=\"my-form\">\n         userType: <input name=\"input\" ng-model=\"userType\" required>\n         <span class=\"error\" ng-show=\"myForm.input.$error.required\">Required!</span><br>\n         <tt>userType = {{userType}}</tt><br>\n         <tt>myForm.input.$valid = {{myForm.input.$valid}}</tt><br>\n         <tt>myForm.input.$error = {{myForm.input.$error}}</tt><br>\n         <tt>myForm.$valid = {{myForm.$valid}}</tt><br>\n         <tt>myForm.$error.required = {{!!myForm.$error.required}}</tt><br>\n        </form>\n      </file>\n      <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n        it('should initialize to model', function() {\n          var userType = element(by.binding('userType'));\n          var valid = element(by.binding('myForm.input.$valid'));\n\n          expect(userType.getText()).toContain('guest');\n          expect(valid.getText()).toContain('true');\n        });\n\n        it('should be invalid if empty', function() {\n          var userType = element(by.binding('userType'));\n          var valid = element(by.binding('myForm.input.$valid'));\n          var userInput = element(by.model('userType'));\n\n          userInput.clear();\n          userInput.sendKeys('');\n\n          expect(userType.getText()).toEqual('userType =');\n          expect(valid.getText()).toContain('false');\n        });\n      </file>\n    </example>\n *\n * @param {string=} name Name of the form.

This is a key aspect of how angular\n * supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.\n *\n * MVC components in angular:\n *\n * * Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties\n *   are accessed through bindings.\n * * View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.\n * * Controller — The `ngController` directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business\n *   logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values\n *\n * Note that you can also attach controllers to the DOM by declaring it in a route definition\n * via the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. A common mistake is to declare the controller\n * again using `ng-controller` in the template itself.  This will cause the controller to be attached\n * and executed twice.\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 500\n * @param {expression} ngController Name of a constructor function registered with the current\n * {@link ng.$controllerProvider $controllerProvider} or an {@link guide/expression expression}\n * that on the current scope evaluates to a constructor function.\n *\n * The controller instance can be published into a scope property by specifying\n * `ng-controller=\"as propertyName\"`.\n *\n * If the current `$controllerProvider` is configured to use globals (via\n * {@link ng.$controllerProvider#allowGlobals `$controllerProvider.allowGlobals()` }), this may\n * also be the name of a globally accessible constructor function (not recommended).\n *\n * @example\n * Here is a simple form for editing user contact information. Adding, removing, clearing, and\n * greeting are methods declared on the controller (see source tab). These methods can\n * easily be called from the angular markup. Any changes to the data are automatically reflected\n * in the View without the need for a manual update.\n *\n * Two different declaration styles are included below:\n *\n * * one binds methods and properties directly onto the controller using `this`:\n * `ng-controller=\"SettingsController1 as settings\"`\n * * one injects `$scope` into the controller:\n * `ng-controller=\"SettingsController2\"`\n *\n * The second option is more common in the Angular community, and is generally used in boilerplates\n * and in this guide. However, there are advantages to binding properties directly to the controller\n * and avoiding scope.\n *\n * * Using `controller as` makes it obvious which controller you are accessing in the template when\n * multiple controllers apply to an element.\n * * If you are writing your controllers as classes you have easier access to the properties and\n * methods, which will appear on the scope, from inside the controller code.\n * * Since there is always a `.` in the bindings, you don't have to worry about prototypal\n * inheritance masking primitives.\n *\n * This example demonstrates the `controller as` syntax.\n *\n * <example name=\"ngControllerAs\" module=\"controllerAsExample\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *    <div id=\"ctrl-as-exmpl\"

@ngdoc directive\n * @name ngCsp\n *\n * @element html\n * @description\n * Enables [CSP (Content Security Policy)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP) support.\n *\n * This is necessary when developing things like Google Chrome Extensions or Universal Windows Apps.\n *\n * CSP forbids apps to use `eval` or `Function(string)` generated functions (among other things).\n * For Angular to be CSP compatible there are only two things that we need to do differently:\n *\n * - don't use `Function` constructor to generate optimized value getters\n * - don't inject custom stylesheet into the document\n *\n * AngularJS uses `Function(string)` generated functions as a speed optimization. Applying the `ngCsp`\n * directive will cause Angular to use CSP compatibility mode. When this mode is on AngularJS will\n * evaluate all expressions up to 30% slower than in non-CSP mode, but no security violations will\n * be raised.\n *\n * CSP forbids JavaScript to inline stylesheet rules. In non CSP mode Angular automatically\n * includes some CSS rules (e.g. {@link ng.directive:ngCloak ngCloak}).\n * To make those directives work in CSP mode, include the `angular-csp.css` manually.\n *\n * Angular tries to autodetect if CSP is active and automatically turn on the CSP-safe mode. This\n * autodetection however triggers a CSP error to be logged in the console:\n *\n * ```\n * Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of\n * script in the following Content Security Policy directive: \"default-src 'self'\". Note that\n * 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.\n * ```\n *\n * This error is harmless but annoying. To prevent the error from showing up, put the `ngCsp`\n * directive on the root element of the application or on the `angular.js` script tag, whichever\n * appears first in the html document.\n *\n * *Note: This directive is only available in the `ng-csp` and `data-ng-csp` attribute form.*\n *\n * @example\n * This example shows how to apply the `ngCsp` directive to the `html` tag.\n   ```html\n

If the expression assigned to `ngIf` evaluates to a false\n * value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the\n * element is reinserted into the DOM.\n *\n * `ngIf` differs from `ngShow` and `ngHide` in that `ngIf` completely removes and recreates the\n * element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the `display` css property.  A common\n * case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's\n * position within the DOM, such as the `:first-child` or `:last-child` pseudo-classes.\n *\n * Note that when an element is removed using `ngIf` its scope is destroyed and a new scope\n * is created when the element is restored.  The scope created within `ngIf` inherits from\n * its parent scope using\n * [prototypal inheritance](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes#javascript-prototypal-inheritance).\n * An important implication of this is if `ngModel` is used within `ngIf` to bind to\n * a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the\n * variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.\n *\n * Also, `ngIf` recreates elements using their compiled state. An example of this behavior\n * is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like\n * jQuery's `.addClass()` method, and the element is later removed. When `ngIf` recreates the element\n * the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.\n *\n * Additionally, you can provide animations via the `ngAnimate` module to animate the `enter`\n * and `leave` effects.\n *\n * @animations\n * enter - happens just after the `ngIf` contents change and a new DOM element is created and injected into the `ngIf` container\n * leave - happens just before the `ngIf` contents are removed from the DOM\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 600\n * @param {expression} ngIf If the {@link guide/expression expression} is falsy then\n *     the element is removed from the DOM tree.

It purposefully does not contain any logic which deals with DOM rendering or\n * listening to DOM events.\n * Such DOM related logic should be provided by other directives which make use of\n * `NgModelController` for data-binding to control elements.\n * Angular provides this DOM logic for most {@link input `input`} elements.\n * At the end of this page you can find a {@link ngModel.NgModelController#custom-control-example\n * custom control example} that uses `ngModelController` to bind to `contenteditable` elements.\n *\n * @example\n * ### Custom Control Example\n * This example shows how to use `NgModelController` with a custom control to achieve\n * data-binding. Notice how different directives (`contenteditable`, `ng-model`, and `required`)\n * collaborate together to achieve the desired result.\n *\n * Note that `contenteditable` is an HTML5 attribute, which tells the browser to let the element\n * contents be edited in place by the user.  This will not work on older browsers.\n *\n * We are using the {@link ng.service:$sce $sce} service here and include the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize}\n * module to automatically remove \"bad\" content like inline event listener (e.g. `<span onclick=\"...\">`).\n * However, as we are using `$sce` the model can still decide to provide unsafe content if it marks\n * that content using the `$sce` service.\n *\n * <example name=\"NgModelController\" module=\"customControl\" deps=\"angular-sanitize.js\">\n    <file name=\"style.css\">\n      [contenteditable] {\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        background-color: white;\n        min-height: 20px;\n      }\n\n      .ng-invalid {\n        border: 1px solid red;\n      }\n\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"script.js\">\n      angular.module('customControl', ['ngSanitize']).\n        directive('contenteditable', ['$sce', function($sce) {\n          return {\n            restrict: 'A', // only activate on element attribute\n            require: '?ngModel', // get a hold of NgModelController\n            link: function(scope, element, attrs, ngModel) {\n              if (!ngModel) return;

These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`,\n * `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any other validations that are performed on the model itself.\n * The animations that are triggered within ngModel are similar to how they work in ngClass and\n * animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well as JS animations.\n *\n * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style an input element\n * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:\n *\n * <pre>\n * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more\n * //advanced animations\n * .my-input {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   background: white;\n * }\n * .my-input.ng-invalid {\n *   background: red;\n *   color:white;\n * }\n * </pre>\n *\n * @example\n * <example deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\" fixBase=\"true\" module=\"inputExample\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <script>\n        angular.module('inputExample', [])\n          .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n            $scope.val = '1';\n          }]);\n       </script>\n       <style>\n         .my-input {\n           -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;\n           transition:all linear 0.5s;\n           background: transparent;\n         }\n         .my-input.ng-invalid {\n           color:white;\n           background: red;\n         }\n       </style>\n       Update input to see transitions when valid/invalid.\n       Integer is a valid value.\n       <form name=\"testForm\" ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n         <input ng-model=\"val\" ng-pattern=\"/^\\d+$/\" name=\"anim\" class=\"my-input\" />\n       </form>\n     </file>\n * </example>\n *\n * ## Binding to a getter/setter\n *\n * Sometimes it's helpful to bind `ngModel` to a getter/setter function.  A getter/setter is a\n * function that returns a representation of the model when called with zero arguments, and sets\n * the internal state of a model when called with an argument. It's sometimes useful to use this\n * for models that have an internal representation that's different than what the model exposes\n * to the view.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n * **Best Practice:** It's best to keep getters fast because Angular is likely to call them more\n * frequently than other parts of your code.\n * </div>\n *\n * You use this behavior by adding `ng-model-options=\"{ getterSetter: true }\"` to an element that\n * has `ng-model` attached to it. You can also add `ng-model-options=\"{ getterSetter: true }\"` to\n * a `<form>`, which will enable this behavior for all `<input>`s within it. See\n * {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions`} for more.\n *\n * The following example shows how to use `ngModel` with a getter/setter:\n *\n * @example\n * <example name=\"ngModel-getter-setter\" module=\"getterSetterExample\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n         <form name=\"userForm\">\n           Name:\n           <input type=\"text\" name=\"userName\"\n                  ng-model=\"user.name\"\n                  ng-model-options=\"{ getterSetter: true }\" />\n         </form>\n         <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind=\"user.name()\"></span></pre>\n       </div>\n     </file>\n     <file name=\"app.js\">\n       angular.module('getterSetterExample', [])\n         .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n           var _name = 'Brian';\n           $scope.user = {\n             name: function(newName) {\n               if (angular.isDefined(newName)) {\n                 _name = newName;\n               }\n               return _name;\n             }\n           };\n         }]);\n     </file>\n * </example>\n */\nvar ngModelDirective = ['$rootScope', function($rootScope) {\n  return {\n    restrict: 'A',\n    require: ['ngModel', '^?form', '^?ngModelOptions'],\n    controller: NgModelController,\n    // Prelink needs to run before any input directive\n    // so that we can set the NgModelOptions in NgModelController\n    // before anyone else uses it.\n    priority: 1,\n    compile: function ngModelCompile(element) {\n      // Setup initial state of the control\n      element.addClass(PRISTINE_CLASS).addClass(UNTOUCHED_CLASS).addClass(VALID_CLASS);\n\n      return {\n        pre: function ngModelPreLink(scope, element, attr, ctrls) {\n          var modelCtrl = ctrls[0],\n              formCtrl = ctrls[1] || nullFormCtrl;\n\n          modelCtrl.$$setOptions(ctrls[2] && ctrls[2].$options);\n\n          // notify others, especially parent forms\n          formCtrl.$addControl(modelCtrl);\n\n          attr.$observe('name', function(newValue) {\n            if (modelCtrl.$name !== newValue) {\n              formCtrl.$$renameControl(modelCtrl, newValue);\n            }\n          });\n\n          scope.$on('$destroy', function() {\n            formCtrl.$removeControl(modelCtrl);\n          });\n        },\n        post: function ngModelPostLink(scope, element, attr, ctrls) {\n          var modelCtrl = ctrls[0];\n          if (modelCtrl.$options && modelCtrl.$options.updateOn) {\n            element.on(modelCtrl.$options.updateOn, function(ev) {\n              modelCtrl.$$debounceViewValueCommit(ev && ev.type);\n            });\n          }\n\n          element.on('blur', function(ev) {\n            if (modelCtrl.$touched) return;\n\n            if ($rootScope.$$phase) {\n              scope.$evalAsync(modelCtrl.$setTouched);\n            } else {\n              scope.$apply(modelCtrl.$setTouched);\n            }\n          });\n        }\n      };\n    }\n  };\n}];\n\nvar DEFAULT_REGEXP = /(\\s+|^)default(\\s+|$)/;\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc directive\n * @name ngModelOptions\n *\n * @description\n * Allows tuning how model updates are done. Using `ngModelOptions` you can specify a custom list of\n * events that will trigger a model update and/or a debouncing delay so that the actual update only\n * takes place when a timer expires; this timer will be reset after another change takes place.\n *\n * Given the nature of `ngModelOptions`, the value displayed inside input fields in the view might\n * be different than the value in the actual model. This means that if you update the model you\n * should also invoke {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`} on the relevant input field in\n * order to make sure it is synchronized with the model and that any debounced action is canceled.\n *\n * The easiest way to reference the control's {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`}\n * method is by making sure the input is placed inside a form that has a `name` attribute. This is\n * important because `form` controllers are published to the related scope under the name in their\n * `name` attribute.\n *\n * Any pending changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is submitted via the\n * `submit` event. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`\n * to have access to the updated model.\n *\n * `ngModelOptions` has an effect on the element it's declared on and its descendants.\n *\n * @param {Object} ngModelOptions options to apply to the current model. Valid keys are:\n *   - `updateOn`: string specifying which event should the input be bound to. You can set several\n *     events using an space delimited list. There is a special event called `default` that\n *     matches the default events belonging of the control.\n *   - `debounce`: integer value which contains the debounce model update value in milliseconds. A\n *     value of 0 triggers an immediate update. If an object is supplied instead, you can specify a\n *     custom value for each event. For example:\n *     `ng-model-options=\"{ updateOn: 'default blur', debounce: {'default': 500, 'blur': 0} }\"`\n *   - `allowInvalid`: boolean value which indicates that the model can be set with values that did\n *     not validate correctly instead of the default behavior of setting the model to undefined.\n *   - `getterSetter`: boolean value which determines whether or not to treat functions bound to\n       `ngModel` as getters/setters.\n *   - `timezone`: Defines the timezone to be used to read/write the `Date` instance in the model for\n *     `<input type=\"date\">`, `<input type=\"time\">`, ... . Right now, the only supported value is `'UTC'`,\n *     otherwise the default timezone of the browser will be used.\n *\n * @example\n\n  The following example shows how to override immediate updates. Changes on the inputs within the\n  form will update the model only when the control loses focus (blur event). If `escape` key is\n  pressed while the input field is focused, the value is reset to the value in the current model.\n\n  <example name=\"ngModelOptions-directive-blur\" module=\"optionsExample\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n        <form name=\"userForm\">\n          Name:\n          <input type=\"text\" name=\"userName\"\n                 ng-model=\"user.name\"\n                 ng-model-options=\"{ updateOn: 'blur' }\"\n                 ng-keyup=\"cancel($event)\" /><br />\n\n          Other data:\n          <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"user.data\" /><br />\n        </form>\n        <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind=\"user.name\"></span></pre>\n      </div>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"app.js\">\n      angular.module('optionsExample', [])\n        .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n          $scope.user = { name: 'say', data: '' };\n\n          $scope.cancel = function(e) {\n            if (e.keyCode == 27) {\n              $scope.userForm.userName.$rollbackViewValue();\n            }\n          };\n        }]);\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n      var model = element(by.binding('user.name'));\n      var input = element(by.model('user.name'));\n      var other = element(by.model('user.data'));\n\n      it('should allow custom events', function() {\n        input.sendKeys(' hello');\n        input.click();\n        expect(model.getText()).toEqual('say');\n        other.click();\n        expect(model.getText()).toEqual('say hello');\n      });\n\n      it('should $rollbackViewValue when model changes', function() {\n        input.sendKeys(' hello');\n        expect(input.getAttribute('value')).toEqual('say hello');\n        input.sendKeys(protractor.Key.ESCAPE);\n        expect(input.getAttribute('value')).toEqual('say');\n        other.click();\n        expect(model.getText()).toEqual('say');\n      });\n    </file>\n  </example>\n\n  This one shows how to debounce model changes.

You configure ngPluralize directive\n * by specifying the mappings between\n * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)\n * and the strings to be displayed.\n *\n * # Plural categories and explicit number rules\n * There are two\n * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)\n * in Angular's default en-US locale: \"one\" and \"other\".\n *\n * While a plural category may match many numbers (for example, in en-US locale, \"other\" can match\n * any number that is not 1), an explicit number rule can only match one number. For example, the\n * explicit number rule for \"3\" matches the number 3. There are examples of plural categories\n * and explicit number rules throughout the rest of this documentation.\n *\n * # Configuring ngPluralize\n * You configure ngPluralize by providing 2 attributes: `count` and `when`.\n * You can also provide an optional attribute, `offset`.\n *\n * The value of the `count` attribute can be either a string or an {@link guide/expression\n * Angular expression}; these are evaluated on the current scope for its bound value.\n *\n * The `when` attribute specifies the mappings between plural categories and the actual\n * string to be displayed. The value of the attribute should be a JSON object.\n *\n * The following example shows how to configure ngPluralize:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ng-pluralize count=\"personCount\"\n                 when=\"{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',\n *                      'one': '1 person is viewing.',\n *                      'other': '{} people are viewing.'}\">\n * </ng-pluralize>\n *```\n *\n * In the example, `\"0: Nobody is viewing.\"` is an explicit number rule. If you did not\n * specify this rule, 0 would be matched to the \"other\" category and \"0 people are viewing\"\n * would be shown instead of \"Nobody is viewing\". You can specify an explicit number rule for\n * other numbers, for example 12, so that instead of showing \"12 people are viewing\", you can\n * show \"a dozen people are viewing\".\n *\n * You can use a set of closed braces (`{}`) as a placeholder for the number that you want substituted\n * into pluralized strings. In the previous example, Angular will replace `{}` with\n * <span ng-non-bindable>`{{personCount}}`</span>. The closed braces `{}` is a placeholder\n * for <span ng-non-bindable>{{numberExpression}}</span>.\n *\n * # Configuring ngPluralize with offset\n * The `offset` attribute allows further customization of pluralized text, which can result in\n * a better user experience. For example, instead of the message \"4 people are viewing this document\",\n * you might display \"John, Kate and 2 others are viewing this document\".\n * The offset attribute allows you to offset a number by any desired value.\n * Let's take a look at an example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ng-pluralize count=\"personCount\" offset=2\n *               when=\"{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',\n *                      '1': '{{person1}} is viewing.',\n *                      '2': '{{person1}} and {{person2}} are viewing.',\n *                      'one': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and one other person are viewing.',\n *                      'other': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and {} other people are viewing.'}\">\n * </ng-pluralize>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that we are still using two plural categories(one, other), but we added\n * three explicit number rules 0, 1 and 2.\n * When one person, perhaps John, views the document, \"John is viewing\" will be shown.\n * When three people view the document, no explicit number rule is found, so\n * an offset of 2 is taken off 3, and Angular uses 1 to decide the plural category.\n * In this case, plural category 'one' is matched and \"John, Mary and one other person are viewing\"\n * is shown.\n *\n * Note that when you specify offsets, you must provide explicit number rules for\n * numbers from 0 up to and including the offset. If you use an offset of 3, for example,\n * you must provide explicit number rules for 0, 1, 2 and 3. You must also provide plural strings for\n * plural categories \"one\" and \"other\".\n *\n * @param {string|expression} count The variable to be bound to.\n * @param {string} when The mapping between plural category to its corresponding strings.\n * @param {number=} offset Offset to deduct from the total number.\n *\n * @example\n    <example module=\"pluralizeExample\">\n      <file name=\"index.html\">\n        <script>\n          angular.module('pluralizeExample', [])\n            .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n              $scope.person1 = 'Igor';\n              $scope.person2 = 'Misko';\n              $scope.personCount = 1;\n            }]);\n        </script>\n        <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n          Person 1:<input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"person1\" value=\"Igor\" /><br/>\n          Person 2:<input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"person2\" value=\"Misko\" /><br/>\n          Number of People:<input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"personCount\" value=\"1\" /><br/>\n\n          <!--- Example with simple pluralization rules for en locale --->\n          Without Offset:\n          <ng-pluralize count=\"personCount\"\n                        when=\"{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',\n                               'one': '1 person is viewing.',\n                               'other': '{} people are viewing.'}\">\n          </ng-pluralize><br>\n\n          <!--- Example with offset --->\n          With Offset(2):\n          <ng-pluralize count=\"personCount\" offset=2\n                        when=\"{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',\n                               '1': '{{person1}} is viewing.',\n                               '2': '{{person1}} and {{person2}} are viewing.',\n                               'one': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and one other person are viewing.',\n                               'other': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and {} other people are viewing.'}\">\n          </ng-pluralize>\n        </div>\n      </file>\n      <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n        it('should show correct pluralized string', function() {\n          var withoutOffset = element.all(by.css('ng-pluralize')).get(0);\n          var withOffset = element.all(by.css('ng-pluralize')).get(1);\n          var countInput = element(by.model('personCount'));\n\n          expect(withoutOffset.getText()).toEqual('1 person is viewing.');\n          expect(withOffset.getText()).toEqual('Igor is viewing.');\n\n          countInput.clear();\n          countInput.sendKeys('0');\n\n          expect(withoutOffset.getText()).toEqual('Nobody is viewing.');\n          expect(withOffset.getText()).toEqual('Nobody is viewing.');\n\n          countInput.clear();\n          countInput.sendKeys('2');\n\n          expect(withoutOffset.getText()).toEqual('2 people are viewing.');\n          expect(withOffset.getText()).toEqual('Igor and Misko are viewing.');\n\n          countInput.clear();\n          countInput.sendKeys('3');\n\n          expect(withoutOffset.getText()).toEqual('3 people are viewing.');\n          expect(withOffset.getText()).toEqual('Igor, Misko and one other person are viewing.');\n\n          countInput.clear();\n          countInput.sendKeys('4');\n\n          expect(withoutOffset.getText()).toEqual('4 people are viewing.');\n          expect(withOffset.getText()).toEqual('Igor, Misko and 2 other people are viewing.');\n        });\n        it('should show data-bound names', function() {\n          var withOffset = element.all(by.css('ng-pluralize')).get(1);\n          var personCount = element(by.model('personCount'));\n          var person1 = element(by.model('person1'));\n          var person2 = element(by.model('person2'));\n          personCount.clear();\n          personCount.sendKeys('4');\n          person1.clear();\n          person1.sendKeys('Di');\n          person2.clear();\n          person2.sendKeys('Vojta');\n          expect(withOffset.getText()).toEqual('Di, Vojta and 2 other people are viewing.');\n        });\n      </file>\n    </example>\n */\nvar ngPluralizeDirective = ['$locale', '$interpolate', function($locale, $interpolate) {\n  var BRACE = /{}/g,\n      IS_WHEN = /^when(Minus)?(.+)$/;\n\n  return {\n    restrict: 'EA',\n    link: function(scope, element, attr) {\n      var numberExp = attr.count,\n          whenExp = attr.$attr.when && element.attr(attr.$attr.when), // we have {{}} in attrs\n          offset = attr.offset || 0,\n          whens = scope.$eval(whenExp) || {},\n          whensExpFns = {},\n          startSymbol = $interpolate.startSymbol(),\n          endSymbol = $interpolate.endSymbol(),\n          braceReplacement = startSymbol + numberExp + '-' + offset + endSymbol,\n          watchRemover = angular.noop,\n          lastCount;\n\n      forEach(attr, function(expression, attributeName) {\n        var tmpMatch = IS_WHEN.exec(attributeName);\n        if (tmpMatch) {\n          var whenKey = (tmpMatch[1] ?

Each template\n * instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item,\n * and `$index` is set to the item index or key.\n *\n * Special properties are exposed on the local scope of each template instance, including:\n *\n * | Variable  | Type            | Details                                                                     |\n * |-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | `$index`  | {@type number}  | iterator offset of the repeated element (0..length-1)                       |\n * | `$first`  | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is first in the iterator.                      |\n * | `$middle` | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is between the first and last in the iterator. |\n * | `$last`   | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is last in the iterator.                       |\n * | `$even`   | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is even (otherwise false).           |\n * | `$odd`    | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is odd (otherwise false).            |\n *\n * Creating aliases for these properties is possible with {@link ng.directive:ngInit `ngInit`}.\n * This may be useful when, for instance, nesting ngRepeats.\n *\n * # Iterating over object properties\n *\n * It is possible to get `ngRepeat` to iterate over the properties of an object using the following\n * syntax:\n *\n * ```js\n * <div ng-repeat=\"(key, value) in myObj\"> ... </div>\n * ```\n *\n * You need to be aware that the JavaScript specification does not define what order\n * it will return the keys for an object. In order to have a guaranteed deterministic order\n * for the keys, Angular versions up to and including 1.3 **sort the keys alphabetically**.\n *\n * If this is not desired, the recommended workaround is to convert your object into an array\n * that is sorted into the order that you prefer before providing it to `ngRepeat`.  You could\n * do this with a filter such as [toArrayFilter](http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular-toArrayFilter)\n * or implement a `$watch` on the object yourself.\n *\n * In version 1.4 we will remove the sorting, since it seems that browsers generally follow the\n * strategy of providing keys in the order in which they were defined, although there are exceptions\n * when keys are deleted and reinstated.\n *\n *\n * # Tracking and Duplicates\n *\n * When the contents of the collection change, `ngRepeat` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n *\n * By default, `ngRepeat` does not allow duplicate items in arrays. This is because when\n * there are duplicates, it is not possible to maintain a one-to-one mapping between collection\n * items and DOM elements.\n *\n * If you do need to repeat duplicate items, you can substitute the default tracking behavior\n * with your own using the `track by` expression.\n *\n * For example, you may track items by the index of each item in the collection, using the\n * special scope property `$index`:\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by $index\">\n *      {{n}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * You may use arbitrary expressions in `track by`, including references to custom functions\n * on the scope:\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by myTrackingFunction(n)\">\n *      {{n}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * If you are working with objects that have an identifier property, you can track\n * by the identifier instead of the whole object. Should you reload your data later, `ngRepeat`\n * will not have to rebuild the DOM elements for items it has already rendered, even if the\n * JavaScript objects in the collection have been substituted for new ones:\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"model in collection track by model.id\">\n *      {{model.name}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * When no `track by` expression is provided, it is equivalent to tracking by the built-in\n * `$id` function, which tracks items by their identity:\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"obj in collection track by $id(obj)\">\n *      {{obj.prop}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * # Special repeat start and end points\n * To repeat a series of elements instead of just one parent element, ngRepeat (as well as other ng directives) supports extending\n * the range of the repeater by defining explicit start and end points by using **ng-repeat-start** and **ng-repeat-end** respectively.\n * The **ng-repeat-start** directive works the same as **ng-repeat**, but will repeat all the HTML code (including the tag it's defined on)\n * up to and including the ending HTML tag where **ng-repeat-end** is placed.\n *\n * The example below makes use of this feature:\n * ```html\n *   <header ng-repeat-start=\"item in items\">\n *     Header {{ item }}\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body {{ item }}\n *   </div>\n *   <footer ng-repeat-end>\n *     Footer {{ item }}\n *   </footer>\n * ```\n *\n * And with an input of {@type ['A','B']} for the items variable in the example above, the output will evaluate to:\n * ```html\n *   <header>\n *     Header A\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body A\n *   </div>\n *   <footer>\n *     Footer A\n *   </footer>\n *   <header>\n *     Header B\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body B\n *   </div>\n *   <footer>\n *     Footer B\n *   </footer>\n * ```\n *\n * The custom start and end points for ngRepeat also support all other HTML directive syntax flavors provided in AngularJS (such\n * as **data-ng-repeat-start**, **x-ng-repeat-start** and **ng:repeat-start**).\n *\n * @animations\n * **.enter** - when a new item is added to the list or when an item is revealed after a filter\n *\n * **.leave** - when an item is removed from the list or when an item is filtered out\n *\n * **.move** - when an adjacent item is filtered out causing a reorder or when the item contents are reordered\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 1000\n * @param {repeat_expression} ngRepeat The expression indicating how to enumerate a collection. These\n *   formats are currently supported:\n *\n *   * `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and `expression`\n *     is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.\n *\n *     For example: `album in artist.albums`.\n *\n *   * `(key, value) in expression` – where `key` and `value` can be any user defined identifiers,\n *     and `expression` is the scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.\n *\n *     For example: `(name, age) in {'adam':10, 'amalie':12}`.\n *\n *   * `variable in expression track by tracking_expression` – You can also provide an optional tracking expression\n *     which can be used to associate the objects in the collection with the DOM elements. If no tracking expression\n *     is specified, ng-repeat associates elements by identity. It is an error to have\n *     more than one tracking expression value resolve to the same key. (This would mean that two distinct objects are\n *     mapped to the same DOM element, which is not possible.)  If filters are used in the expression, they should be\n *     applied before the tracking expression.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items` is equivalent to `item in items track by $id(item)`. This implies that the DOM elements\n *     will be associated by item identity in the array.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items track by $id(item)`. A built in `$id()` function can be used to assign a unique\n *     `$$hashKey` property to each item in the array. This property is then used as a key to associated DOM elements\n *     with the corresponding item in the array by identity. Moving the same object in array would move the DOM\n *     element in the same way in the DOM.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items track by item.id` is a typical pattern when the items come from the database. In this\n *     case the object identity does not matter. Two objects are considered equivalent as long as their `id`\n *     property is same.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items | filter:searchText track by item.id` is a pattern that might be used to apply a filter\n *     to items in conjunction with a tracking expression.\n *\n *   * `variable in expression as alias_expression` – You can also provide an optional alias expression which will then store the\n *     intermediate results of the repeater after the filters have been applied. Typically this is used to render a special message\n *     when a filter is active on the repeater, but the filtered result set is empty.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items | filter:x as results` will store the fragment of the repeated items as `results`, but only after\n *     the items have been processed through the filter.\n *\n * @example\n * This example initializes the scope to a list of names and\n * then uses `ngRepeat` to display every person:\n  <example module=\"ngAnimate\" deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      <div ng-init=\"friends = [\n        {name:'John', age:25, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Jessie', age:30, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Johanna', age:28, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Joy', age:15, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Mary', age:28, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Peter', age:95, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Sebastian', age:50, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Erika', age:27, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Patrick', age:40, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Samantha', age:60, gender:'girl'}\n      ]\">\n        I have {{friends.length}} friends.

The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding\n * the `.ng-hide` CSS class onto the element. The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined\n * in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an !important flag).\n * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is visible) -->\n * <div ng-show=\"myValue\"></div>\n *\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is hidden) -->\n * <div ng-show=\"myValue\" class=\"ng-hide\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * When the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a falsy value then the `.ng-hide` CSS class is added to the class\n * attribute on the element causing it to become hidden. When truthy, the `.ng-hide` CSS class is removed\n * from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.\n *\n * ## Why is !important used?\n *\n * You may be wondering why !important is used for the `.ng-hide` CSS class. This is because the `.ng-hide` selector\n * can be easily overridden by heavier selectors. For example, something as simple\n * as changing the display style on a HTML list item would make hidden elements appear visible.\n * This also becomes a bigger issue when dealing with CSS frameworks.\n *\n * By using !important, the show and hide behavior will work as expected despite any clash between CSS selector\n * specificity (when !important isn't used with any conflicting styles). If a developer chooses to override the\n * styling to change how to hide an element then it is just a matter of using !important in their own CSS code.\n *\n * ### Overriding `.ng-hide`\n *\n * By default, the `.ng-hide` class will style the element with `display: none!important`. If you wish to change\n * the hide behavior with ngShow/ngHide then this can be achieved by restating the styles for the `.ng-hide`\n * class CSS. Note that the selector that needs to be used is actually `.ng-hide:not(.ng-hide-animate)` to cope\n * with extra animation classes that can be added.\n *\n * ```css\n * .ng-hide:not(.ng-hide-animate) {\n *   /&#42; this is just another form of hiding an element &#42;/\n *   display: block!important;\n *   position: absolute;\n *   top: -9999px;\n *   left: -9999px;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * By default you don't need to override in CSS anything and the animations will work around the display style.\n *\n * ## A note about animations with `ngShow`\n *\n * Animations in ngShow/ngHide work with the show and hide events that are triggered when the directive expression\n * is true and false. This system works like the animation system present with ngClass except that\n * you must also include the !important flag to override the display property\n * so that you can perform an animation when the element is hidden during the time of the animation.\n *\n * ```css\n * //\n * //a working example can be found at the bottom of this page\n * //\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add, .my-element.ng-hide-remove {\n *   /&#42; this is required as of 1.3x to properly\n *      apply all styling in a show/hide animation &#42;/\n *   transition: 0s linear all;\n * }\n *\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add-active,\n * .my-element.ng-hide-remove-active {\n *   /&#42; the transition is defined in the active class &#42;/\n *   transition: 1s linear all;\n * }\n *\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-remove { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * Keep in mind that, as of AngularJS version 1.3.0-beta.11, there is no need to change the display\n * property to block during animation states--ngAnimate will handle the style toggling automatically for you.\n *\n * @animations\n * addClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a truthy value and the just before contents are set to visible\n * removeClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a non truthy value and just before the contents are set to hidden\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @param {expression} ngShow If the {@link guide/expression expression} is truthy\n *     then the element is shown or hidden respectively.\n *\n * @example\n  <example module=\"ngAnimate\" deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      Click me: <input type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"checked\"><br/>\n      <div>\n        Show:\n        <div class=\"check-element animate-show\" ng-show=\"checked\">\n          <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up\"></span> I show up when your checkbox is checked.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        Hide:\n        <div class=\"check-element animate-show\" ng-hide=\"checked\">\n          <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-down\"></span> I hide when your checkbox is checked.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"glyphicons.css\">\n      @import url(../../components/bootstrap-3.1.1/css/bootstrap.css);\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"animations.css\">\n      .animate-show {\n        line-height: 20px;\n        opacity: 1;\n        padding: 10px;\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        background: white;\n      }\n\n      .animate-show.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active,\n      .animate-show.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active {\n        -webkit-transition: all linear 0.5s;\n        transition: all linear 0.5s;\n      }\n\n      .animate-show.ng-hide {\n        line-height: 0;\n        opacity: 0;\n        padding: 0 10px;\n      }\n\n      .check-element {\n        padding: 10px;\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        background: white;\n      }\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n      var thumbsUp = element(by.css('span.glyphicon-thumbs-up'));\n      var thumbsDown = element(by.css('span.glyphicon-thumbs-down'));\n\n      it('should check ng-show / ng-hide', function() {\n        expect(thumbsUp.isDisplayed()).toBeFalsy();\n        expect(thumbsDown.isDisplayed()).toBeTruthy();\n\n        element(by.model('checked')).click();\n\n        expect(thumbsUp.isDisplayed()).toBeTruthy();\n        expect(thumbsDown.isDisplayed()).toBeFalsy();\n      });\n    </file>\n  </example>\n */\nvar ngShowDirective = ['$animate', function($animate) {\n  return {\n    restrict: 'A',\n    multiElement: true,\n    link: function(scope, element, attr) {\n      scope.$watch(attr.ngShow, function ngShowWatchAction(value) {\n        // we're adding a temporary, animation-specific class for ng-hide since this way\n        // we can control when the element is actually displayed on screen without having\n        // to have a global/greedy CSS selector that breaks when other animations are run.\n        // Read: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/9103#issuecomment-58335845\n        $animate[value ?

The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding\n * the `ng-hide` CSS class onto the element. The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined\n * in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an !important flag).\n * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is hidden) -->\n * <div ng-hide=\"myValue\" class=\"ng-hide\"></div>\n *\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is visible) -->\n * <div ng-hide=\"myValue\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * When the `ngHide` expression evaluates to a truthy value then the `.ng-hide` CSS class is added to the class\n * attribute on the element causing it to become hidden. When falsy, the `.ng-hide` CSS class is removed\n * from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.\n *\n * ## Why is !important used?\n *\n * You may be wondering why !important is used for the `.ng-hide` CSS class. This is because the `.ng-hide` selector\n * can be easily overridden by heavier selectors. For example, something as simple\n * as changing the display style on a HTML list item would make hidden elements appear visible.\n * This also becomes a bigger issue when dealing with CSS frameworks.\n *\n * By using !important, the show and hide behavior will work as expected despite any clash between CSS selector\n * specificity (when !important isn't used with any conflicting styles). If a developer chooses to override the\n * styling to change how to hide an element then it is just a matter of using !important in their own CSS code.\n *\n * ### Overriding `.ng-hide`\n *\n * By default, the `.ng-hide` class will style the element with `display: none!important`. If you wish to change\n * the hide behavior with ngShow/ngHide then this can be achieved by restating the styles for the `.ng-hide`\n * class in CSS:\n *\n * ```css\n * .ng-hide {\n *   /&#42; this is just another form of hiding an element &#42;/\n *   display: block!important;\n *   position: absolute;\n *   top: -9999px;\n *   left: -9999px;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * By default you don't need to override in CSS anything and the animations will work around the display style.\n *\n * ## A note about animations with `ngHide`\n *\n * Animations in ngShow/ngHide work with the show and hide events that are triggered when the directive expression\n * is true and false. This system works like the animation system present with ngClass, except that the `.ng-hide`\n * CSS class is added and removed for you instead of your own CSS class.\n *\n * ```css\n * //\n * //a working example can be found at the bottom of this page\n * //\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add, .my-element.ng-hide-remove {\n *   transition: 0.5s linear all;\n * }\n *\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-remove { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * Keep in mind that, as of AngularJS version 1.3.0-beta.11, there is no need to change the display\n * property to block during animation states--ngAnimate will handle the style toggling automatically for you.\n *\n * @animations\n * removeClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngHide` expression evaluates to a truthy value and just before the contents are set to hidden\n * addClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngHide` expression evaluates to a non truthy value and just before the contents are set to visible\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @param {expression} ngHide If the {@link guide/expression expression} is truthy then\n *     the element is shown or hidden respectively.\n *\n * @example\n  <example module=\"ngAnimate\" deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      Click me: <input type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"checked\"><br/>\n      <div>\n        Show:\n        <div class=\"check-element animate-hide\" ng-show=\"checked\">\n          <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up\"></span> I show up when your checkbox is checked.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        Hide:\n        <div class=\"check-element animate-hide\" ng-hide=\"checked\">\n          <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-down\"></span> I hide when your checkbox is checked.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"glyphicons.css\">\n      @import url(../../components/bootstrap-3.1.1/css/bootstrap.css);\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"animations.css\">\n      .animate-hide {\n        -webkit-transition: all linear 0.5s;\n        transition: all linear 0.5s;\n        line-height: 20px;\n        opacity: 1;\n        padding: 10px;\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        background: white;\n      }\n\n      .animate-hide.ng-hide {\n        line-height: 0;\n        opacity: 0;\n        padding: 0 10px;\n      }\n\n      .check-element {\n        padding: 10px;\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        background: white;\n      }\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n      var thumbsUp = element(by.css('span.glyphicon-thumbs-up'));\n      var thumbsDown = element(by.css('span.glyphicon-thumbs-down'));\n\n      it('should check ng-show / ng-hide', function() {\n        expect(thumbsUp.isDisplayed()).toBeFalsy();\n        expect(thumbsDown.isDisplayed()).toBeTruthy();\n\n        element(by.model('checked')).click();\n\n        expect(thumbsUp.isDisplayed()).toBeTruthy();\n        expect(thumbsDown.isDisplayed()).toBeFalsy();\n      });\n    </file>\n  </example>\n */\nvar ngHideDirective = ['$animate', function($animate) {\n  return {\n    restrict: 'A',\n    multiElement: true,\n    link: function(scope, element, attr) {\n      scope.$watch(attr.ngHide, function ngHideWatchAction(value) {\n        // The comment inside of the ngShowDirective explains why we add and\n        // remove a temporary class for the show/hide animation\n        $animate[value ?

However, `ngOptions` provides some benefits such as reducing memory and\n * increasing speed by not creating a new scope for each repeated instance, as well as providing\n * more flexibility in how the `<select>`'s model is assigned via the `select` **`as`** part of the\n * comprehension expression. `ngOptions` should be used when the `<select>` model needs to be bound\n *  to a non-string value. This is because an option element can only be bound to string values at\n * present.\n *\n * When an item in the `<select>` menu is selected, the array element or object property\n * represented by the selected option will be bound to the model identified by the `ngModel`\n * directive.\n *\n * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can\n * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or \"not selected\"\n * option. See example below for demonstration.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** `ngModel` compares by reference, not value. This is important when binding to an\n * array of objects. See an example [in this jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/qWzTb/).\n * </div>\n *\n * ## `select` **`as`**\n *\n * Using `select` **`as`** will bind the result of the `select` expression to the model, but\n * the value of the `<select>` and `<option>` html elements will be either the index (for array data sources)\n * or property name (for object data sources) of the value within the collection. If a **`track by`** expression\n * is used, the result of that expression will be set as the value of the `option` and `select` elements.\n *\n *\n * ### `select` **`as`** and **`track by`**\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * Do not use `select` **`as`** and **`track by`** in the same expression. They are not designed to work together.\n * </div>\n *\n * Consider the following example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <select ng-options=\"item.subItem as item.label for item in values track by item.id\" ng-model=\"selected\">\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * $scope.values = [{\n *   id: 1,\n *   label: 'aLabel',\n *   subItem: { name: 'aSubItem' }\n * }, {\n *   id: 2,\n *   label: 'bLabel',\n *   subItem: { name: 'bSubItem' }\n * }];\n *\n * $scope.selected = { name: 'aSubItem' };\n * ```\n *\n * With the purpose of preserving the selection, the **`track by`** expression is always applied to the element\n * of the data source (to `item` in this example). To calculate whether an element is selected, we do the\n * following:\n *\n * 1. Apply **`track by`** to the elements in the array. In the example: `[1, 2]`\n * 2. Apply **`track by`** to the already selected value in `ngModel`.\n *    In the example: this is not possible as **`track by`** refers to `item.id`, but the selected\n *    value from `ngModel` is `{name: 'aSubItem'}`, so the **`track by`** expression is applied to\n *    a wrong object, the selected element can't be found, `<select>` is always reset to the \"not\n *    selected\" option.\n *\n *\n * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.\n * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.\n * @param {string=} required The control is considered valid only if value is entered.\n * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to\n *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of\n *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.\n * @param {comprehension_expression=} ngOptions in one of the following forms:\n *\n *   * for array data sources:\n *     * `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`\n *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`\n *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`\n *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` **`track by`** `trackexpr`\n *     * `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` | orderBy:`orderexpr` **`track by`** `trackexpr`\n *        (for including a filter with `track by`)\n *   * for object data sources:\n *     * `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`\n *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`\n *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for (`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`\n *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`group by`** `group`\n *         **`for` `(`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`\n *\n * Where:\n *\n *   * `array` / `object`: an expression which evaluates to an array / object to iterate over.\n *   * `value`: local variable which will refer to each item in the `array` or each property value\n *      of `object` during iteration.\n *   * `key`: local variable which will refer to a property name in `object` during iteration.\n *   * `label`: The result of this expression will be the label for `<option>` element. The\n *     `expression` will most likely refer to the `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`).\n *   * `select`: The result of this expression will be bound to the model of the parent `<select>`\n *      element. If not specified, `select` expression will default to `value`.\n *   * `group`: The result of this expression will be used to group options using the `<optgroup>`\n *      DOM element.\n *   * `trackexpr`: Used when working with an array of objects. The result of this expression will be\n *      used to identify the objects in the array. The `trackexpr` will most likely refer to the\n *     `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`). With this the selection is preserved\n *      even when the options are recreated (e.g. reloaded from the server).\n *\n * @example\n    <example module=\"selectExample\">\n      <file name=\"index.html\">\n        <script>\n        angular.module('selectExample', [])\n          .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n            $scope.colors = [\n              {name:'black', shade:'dark'},\n              {name:'white', shade:'light'},\n              {name:'red', shade:'dark'},\n              {name:'blue', shade:'dark'},\n              {name:'yellow', shade:'light'}\n            ];\n            $scope.myColor = $scope.colors[2];

All characters up\n   *        to the next slash are matched and stored in `$routeParams` under the given `name`\n   *        when the route matches.\n   *      * `path` can contain named groups starting with a colon and ending with a star:\n   *        e.g.`:name*`.

If present the controller will be\n   *      published to scope under the `controllerAs` name.\n   *    - `template` – `{string=|function()=}` – html template as a string or a function that\n   *      returns an html template as a string which should be used by {@link\n   *      ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView} or {@link ng.directive:ngInclude ngInclude} directives.\n   *      This property takes precedence over `templateUrl`.\n   *\n   *      If `template` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:\n   *\n   *      - `{Array.<Object>}` - route parameters extracted from the current\n   *        `$location.path()` by applying the current route\n   *\n   *    - `templateUrl` – `{string=|function()=}` – path or function that returns a path to an html\n   *      template that should be used by {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView}.\n   *\n   *      If `templateUrl` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:\n   *\n   *      - `{Array.<Object>}` - route parameters extracted from the current\n   *        `$location.path()` by applying the current route\n   *\n   *    - `resolve` - `{Object.<string, function>=}` - An optional map of dependencies which should\n   *      be injected into the controller. If any of these dependencies are promises, the router\n   *      will wait for them all to be resolved or one to be rejected before the controller is\n   *      instantiated.\n   *      If all the promises are resolved successfully, the values of the resolved promises are\n   *      injected and {@link ngRoute.$route#$routeChangeSuccess $routeChangeSuccess} event is\n   *      fired. If any of the promises are rejected the\n   *      {@link ngRoute.$route#$routeChangeError $routeChangeError} event is fired. The map object\n   *      is:\n   *\n   *      - `key` – `{string}`: a name of a dependency to be injected into the controller.\n   *      - `factory` - `{string|function}`: If `string` then it is an alias for a service.\n   *        Otherwise if function, then it is {@link api/AUTO.$injector#invoke injected}\n   *        and the return value is treated as the dependency.

* The `$routeParams` service allows you to retrieve the current set of route parameters.\n *\n * Requires the {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`} module to be installed.\n *\n * The route parameters are a combination of {@link ng.$location `$location`}'s\n * {@link ng.$location#methods_search `search()`} and {@link ng.$location#methods_path `path()`}.\n * The `path` parameters are extracted when the {@link ngRoute.$route `$route`} path is matched.\n *\n * In case of parameter name collision, `path` params take precedence over `search` params.\n *\n * The service guarantees that the identity of the `$routeParams` object will remain unchanged\n * (but its properties will likely change) even when a route change occurs.\n *\n * Note that the `$routeParams` are only updated *after* a route change completes successfully.\n * This means that you cannot rely on `$routeParams` being correct in route resolve functions.\n * Instead you can use `$route.current.params` to access the new route's parameters.\n *\n * @example\n * <pre>\n *  // Given:\n *  // URL: http://server.com/index.html#/Chapter/1/Section/2?search=moby\n *  // Route: /Chapter/:chapterId/Section/:sectionId\n *  //\n *  //

enhanced support for displaying messages within templates\n * (typically within forms or when rendering message objects that return key/value data).\n * Instead of relying on JavaScript code and/or complex ng-if statements within your form template to\n * show and hide error messages specific to the state of an input field, the `ngMessages` and\n * `ngMessage` directives are designed to handle the complexity, inheritance and priority\n * sequencing based on the order of how the messages are defined in the template.\n *\n * Currently, the ngMessages module only contains the code for the `ngMessages`\n * and `ngMessage` directives.\n *\n * # Usage\n * The `ngMessages` directive listens on a key/value collection which is set on the ngMessages attribute.\n * Since the {@link ngModel ngModel} directive exposes an `$error` object, this error object can be\n * used with `ngMessages` to display control error messages in an easier way than with just regular angular\n * template directives.\n *\n * ```html\n * <form name=\"myForm\">\n *   <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"field\" name=\"myField\" required minlength=\"5\" />\n *   <div ng-messages=\"myForm.myField.$error\">\n *     <div ng-message=\"required\">You did not enter a field</div>\n *     <div ng-message=\"minlength\">The value entered is too short</div>\n *   </div>\n * </form>\n * ```\n *\n * Now whatever key/value entries are present within the provided object (in this case `$error`) then\n * the ngMessages directive will render the inner first ngMessage directive (depending if the key values\n * match the attribute value present on each ngMessage directive). In other words, if your errors\n * object contains the following data:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * <!-- keep in mind that ngModel automatically sets these error flags -->\n * myField.$error = { minlength : true, required : false };\n * ```\n *\n * Then the `required` message will be displayed first. When required is false then the `minlength` message\n * will be displayed right after (since these messages are ordered this way in the template HTML code).\n * The prioritization of each message is determined by what order they're present in the DOM.\n * Therefore, instead of having custom JavaScript code determine the priority of what errors are\n * present before others, the presentation of the errors are handled within the template.\n *\n * By default, ngMessages will only display one error at a time. However, if you wish to display all\n * messages then the `ng-messages-multiple` attribute flag can be used on the element containing the\n * ngMessages directive to make this happen.\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-messages=\"myForm.myField.$error\" ng-messages-multiple>...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ## Reusing and Overriding Messages\n * In addition to prioritization, ngMessages also allows for including messages from a remote or an inline\n * template. This allows for generic collection of messages to be reused across multiple parts of an\n * application.\n *\n * ```html\n * <script type=\"text/ng-template\" id=\"error-messages\">\n *   <div ng-message=\"required\">This field is required</div>\n *   <div ng-message=\"minlength\">This field is too short</div>\n * </script>\n * <div ng-messages=\"myForm.myField.$error\" ng-messages-include=\"error-messages\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * However, including generic messages may not be useful enough to match all input fields, therefore,\n * `ngMessages` provides the ability to override messages defined in the remote template by redefining\n * then within the directive container.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- a generic template of error messages known as \"my-custom-messages\" -->\n * <script type=\"text/ng-template\" id=\"my-custom-messages\">\n *   <div ng-message=\"required\">This field is required</div>\n *   <div ng-message=\"minlength\">This field is too short</div>\n * </script>\n *\n * <form name=\"myForm\">\n *   <input type=\"email\"\n *          id=\"email\"\n *          name=\"myEmail\"\n *          ng-model=\"email\"\n *          minlength=\"5\"\n *          required />\n *\n *   <div ng-messages=\"myForm.myEmail.$error\" ng-messages-include=\"my-custom-messages\">\n *     <!-- this required message has overridden the template message -->\n *     <div ng-message=\"required\">You did not enter your email address</div>\n *\n *     <!-- this is a brand new message and will appear last in the prioritization -->\n *     <div ng-message=\"email\">Your email address is invalid</div>\n *   </div>\n * </form>\n * ```\n *\n * In the example HTML code above the message that is set on required will override the corresponding\n * required message defined within the remote template. Therefore, with particular input fields (such\n * email addresses, date fields, autocomplete inputs, etc...), specialized error messages can be applied\n * while more generic messages can be used to handle other, more general input errors.\n *\n * ## Animations\n * If the `ngAnimate` module is active within the application then both the `ngMessages` and\n * `ngMessage` directives will trigger animations whenever any messages are added and removed\n * from the DOM by the `ngMessages` directive.\n *\n * Whenever the `ngMessages` directive contains one or more visible messages then the `.ng-active` CSS\n * class will be added to the element. The `.ng-inactive` CSS class will be applied when there are no\n * animations present. Therefore, CSS transitions and keyframes as well as JavaScript animations can\n * hook into the animations whenever these classes are added/removed.\n *\n * Let's say that our HTML code for our messages container looks like so:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-messages=\"myMessages\" class=\"my-messages\">\n *   <div ng-message=\"alert\" class=\"some-message\">...</div>\n *   <div ng-message=\"fail\" class=\"some-message\">...</div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Then the CSS animation code for the message container looks like so:\n *\n * ```css\n * .my-messages {\n *   transition:1s linear all;\n * }\n * .my-messages.ng-active {\n *   // messages are visible\n * }\n * .my-messages.ng-inactive {\n *   // messages are hidden\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Whenever an inner message is attached (becomes visible) or removed (becomes hidden) then the enter\n * and leave animation is triggered for each particular element bound to the `ngMessage` directive.\n *\n * Therefore, the CSS code for the inner messages looks like so:\n *\n * ```css\n * .some-message {\n *   transition:1s linear all;\n * }\n *\n * .some-message.ng-enter {}\n * .some-message.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {}\n *\n * .some-message.ng-leave {}\n * .some-message.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {}\n * ```\n *\n * {@link ngAnimate Click here} to learn how to use JavaScript animations or to learn more about ngAnimate.\n */\nangular.module('ngMessages', [])\n\n   /**\n    * @ngdoc directive\n    * @module ngMessages\n    * @name ngMessages\n    * @restrict AE\n    *\n    * @description\n    * `ngMessages` is a directive that is designed to show and hide messages based on the state\n    * of a key/value object that it listens on.

This name becomes the name of the method on\n *     your resource object.\n *   - **`method`** – {string} – HTTP request method. Valid methods are: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`,\n *     `DELETE`, and `JSONP`.\n *   - **`params`** – {Object=} – Optional set of pre-bound parameters for this action. If any of\n *     the parameter value is a function, it will be executed every time when a param value needs to\n *     be obtained for a request (unless the param was overridden).\n *   - **`url`** – {string} – action specific `url` override. The url templating is supported just\n *     like for the resource-level urls.\n *   - **`isArray`** – {boolean=} – If true then the returned object for this action is an array,\n *     see `returns` section.\n *   - **`transformRequest`** –\n *     `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –\n *     transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n *     request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.\n *   - **`transformResponse`** –\n *     `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –\n *     transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n *     response body and headers and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.\n *   - **`cache`** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the\n *     GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with\n *     {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory}, this cache will be used for\n *     caching.\n *   - **`timeout`** – `{number|Promise}` – timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise} that\n *     should abort the request when resolved.\n *   - **`withCredentials`** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the\n *     XHR object. See {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control#section_5\n *     requests with credentials} for more information.\n *   - **`responseType`** - `{string}` - see {@link\n *     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType requestType}.\n *   - **`interceptor`** - `{Object=}` - The interceptor object has two optional methods -\n *     `response` and `responseError`. Both `response` and `responseError` interceptors get called\n *     with `http response` object. See {@link ng.$http $http interceptors}.\n *\n * @returns {Object} A resource \"class\" object with methods for the default set of resource actions\n *   optionally extended with custom `actions`. The default set contains these actions:\n *\n *       { 'get':    {method:'GET'},\n *         'save':   {method:'POST'},\n *         'query':  {method:'GET', isArray:true},\n *         'remove': {method:'DELETE'},\n *         'delete': {method:'DELETE'} };\n *\n *   Calling these methods invoke an {@link ng.$http} with the specified http method,\n *   destination and parameters. When the data is returned from the server then the object is an\n *   instance of the resource class. The actions `save`, `remove` and `delete` are available on it\n *   as  methods with the `$` prefix. This allows you to easily perform CRUD operations (create,\n *   read, update, delete) on server-side data like this:\n *   <pre>\n        var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});\n        var user = User.get({userId:123}, function() {\n          user.abc = true;\n          user.$save();\n        });\n     </pre>\n *\n *   It is important to realize that invoking a $resource object method immediately returns an\n *   empty reference (object or array depending on `isArray`). Once the data is returned from the\n *   server the existing reference is populated with the actual data. This is a useful trick since\n *   usually the resource is assigned to a model which is then rendered by the view. Having an empty\n *   object results in no rendering, once the data arrives from the server then the object is\n *   populated with the data and the view automatically re-renders itself showing the new data. This\n *   means that in most cases one never has to write a callback function for the action methods.\n *\n *   The action methods on the class object or instance object can be invoked with the following\n *   parameters:\n *\n *   - HTTP GET \"class\" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], [success], [error])`\n *   - non-GET \"class\" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], postData, [success], [error])`\n *   - non-GET instance actions:  `instance.$action([parameters], [success], [error])`\n *\n *   Success callback is called with (value, responseHeaders) arguments. Error callback is called\n *   with (httpResponse) argument.\n *\n *   Class actions return empty instance (with additional properties below).\n *   Instance actions return promise of the action.\n *\n *   The Resource instances and collection have these additional properties:\n *\n *   - `$promise`: the {@link ng.$q promise} of the original server interaction that created this\n *     instance or collection.\n *\n *     On success, the promise is resolved with the same resource instance or collection object,\n *     updated with data from server. This makes it easy to use in\n *     {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider resolve section of $routeProvider.when()} to defer view\n *     rendering until the resource(s) are loaded.\n *\n *     On failure, the promise is resolved with the {@link ng.$http http response} object, without\n *     the `resource` property.\n *\n *   - `$resolved`: `true` after first server interaction is completed (either with success or\n *      rejection), `false` before that. Knowing if the Resource has been resolved is useful in\n *      data-binding.\n *\n * @example\n *\n * # Credit card resource\n *\n * <pre>\n     // Define CreditCard class\n     var CreditCard = $resource('/user/:userId/card/:cardId',\n      {userId:123, cardId:'@id'}, {\n       charge: {method:'POST', params:{charge:true}}\n      });\n\n     // We can retrieve a collection from the server\n     var cards = CreditCard.query(function() {\n       // GET: /user/123/card\n       // server returns: [ {id:456, number:'1234', name:'Smith'} ];\n\n       var card = cards[0];\n       // each item is an instance of CreditCard\n       expect(card instanceof CreditCard).toEqual(true);\n       card.name = \"J. Smith\";\n       // non GET methods are mapped onto the instances\n       card.$save();\n       // POST: /user/123/card/456 {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J. Smith'}\n       // server returns: {id:456, number:'1234', name: 'J.
